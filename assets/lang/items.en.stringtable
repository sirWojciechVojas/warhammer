      <DefaultText>Whether single-edged or double-edged, swords are always straight-bladed one-handed weapons that can be used to cut or thrust at an enemy. In some circumstances, swords lack the raw slashing power of sabres, but they are more flexible against a variety of armor types.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Mail armor is quite popular for its protective qualities, especially against slashing attacks. Mail is comprised of thousands of small rings of steel that form a flexible mesh. Normally worn over a padded jacket, mail protects well but restricts its wearer in combat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Despite its unassuming appearance, brigandine provides impressive protection to its wearer at a cost of speed in combat. It is made of dozens of steel plates sandwiched between canvas or leather. The plates are held in place by distinctive rivets across the surface of the brigandine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hide armor is commonly worn by woodsmen, Glanfathan explorers, and those who favor speed over protection. Hide armor is made of layers of soft leather. Though its construction often requires multiple layers to provide dependable protection, it does little to slow its wearer in combat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This sword is crafted from the so-called "Black Steel" forged in the western reaches of Aedyr, in the erldom of Ymyra. Though the weapon's black color is simply the result of bluing treatments during the forging process, it is a trademark of Ymyran smiths and symbolizes the high quality of the weapon. Due to its fine construction, this weapon has all of the potency of a normal steel sword but less of the weight, allowing its wielder to attack more swiftly.</DefaultText>

      <ID>100</ID>
      <DefaultText>This slender steel scepter is topped with a gilded, feminine hand, each finger ending in a delicate mother-of-pearl nail. It was forged and crafted by the smiths and artisans of Delwin, a small town in the foothills of the Magmear Mountains in the southern reaches of the Aedyr Empire. The recipient was Lady Ryga Adalwan, 3rd Margréfa of Maghanon, who had recently emerged victorious from a brutal campaign against her march by barbarians and agents of a rival family. In leading the defense of the march, Lady Ryga had lost her left hand. The emperor had this scepter created to reward her sacrifice during the protection of what was then the empire's southernmost territory.

Unfortunately for the Adalwan family, they only held the Maghanon territories for two more generations. With little money and no land, the family set out for the young colonies of the Dyrwood. The Lady's Hand saw renewed use in battle by Branon Adalwan, Thayn of the Low Meadows, during the War of Black Trees. There, Branon used it to defeat Glanfathan warriors and spirit-animated trees that were marching out of the deep woods. For his service to the colonies, Branon was made an erl of the new territory of Blackstand. But bad luck struck the Adalwan family twice. Only a year after establishing a fort on the frontier, Branon was ambushed by Glanfathan resistance fighters. Finishing their main mission, the assassins then pursued his small family and killed every member, leaving no heirs to the house of Adalwan.

Following the reinforcement of Blackstand's fort by its new erl, the Adalwan family's belongings were distributed according to the known wishes of Branon. Notably, the Lady's Hand, his great-great grandmother's gift from the emperor, was bequeathed to Sir Hareg Kardaf, a minor knight of New Heomar, alongside whom Branon had fought in the War of Black Trees. More comfortable with sword and shield than scepter and grimoire, Sir Hareg displayed his friend's gift prominently in his home, but it never saw use in battle again.</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>103</ID>
      <DefaultText>A young weapon with a relatively short history, the Rose was forged from blackened Ymyran steel and topped with a wickedly thorny "bloom" of petals. The morning star's resemblance to its namesake doesn't end with the head. Its long, faded black shaft also features small thorns along its entire length, causing discomfort even to an armored wielder.

Hacran Grist, a successful adventurer from the Readceran seaside village of Salthollow, had the gnarly weapon made after his friends joked about how nothing could grow in the alkaline soil of their home. Hacran used the Rose to defend Salthollow from bandits and to help his comrades kill two sky drakes who had made their lair near a road leading into the village. When Salthollow no longer held the wonder for them that it once had, Hacran and his friends made their way to Dyrwood to seek their fortunes in the ruins of Eir Glanfath. They have not been heard from since.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This hefty warhammer bears the marks of ancient Engwithan smiths. Lacking fine decorative elements, the steel surfaces are crude by contemporary standards, but they have been engraved with ancient symbols of power. In some ways, it resembles a smith's hammer, but its size and balance make it clear that it was meant for use in battle.</DefaultText>

Aloth's neat, careful calligraphy has been painted across the pages, forming an orderly catalogue of the spells he's learned and the incantations required to cast them. Arcane symbols shimmer and writhe across the pages, ready to absorb and channel energy. You feel traces of Aloth's essence within the grimoire and can almost hear him reciting his spells with measured precision.</DefaultText>

"My journal is molting pages. I do not know if any part of my account will survive this expedition. 

We thought Sceyda lost alongside Edriga, but she has returned, carrying a strange seal and a smirk on her face despite her injuries. She is badly wounded, and Merec is tending to her. 

I have been researching the seal in the meantime. It is of an intricate design, made of adra shaped around a small bloodstone gem. It seems one of our predecessors was attempting to translate some of the inscriptions in these ruins. According to his texts, these seals were carried by three Engwithan overseers, all bearing titles - The Guardian, the Builder, and the Scribe. This one seems to have belonged to the Guardian, who was charged with defending these ruins against incursions from dangerous beasts. 

I have to admit I don't believe he did a very good job of that."

"Sceyda did not make it. I know Merec tried his best.

'No point in turning back now.' That's what Merec is saying. I think the point is leaving these ruins alive. We have lost half of our people already, and I am not sure how we are meant to survive this place, especially with Sceyda gone. The gods were kind to let us find that study and the books there. Those tomes would fetch a good price in and of themselves. We don't need to go any further. 

But that seal has stirred his blood. He's sure we'll find more Engwithan relics below. Every step takes us further from a guaranteed haul, and deeper into unknown territory. I don't know what madness has gripped him. 

I cannot stop thinking about Edriga. The way she screamed."

We'll find some new band of fools willing to take on the Endless Paths. Sell them the keys to the deeper vaults. Let them have all the glory. Meanwhile, we retire and live a long and quiet life.

      <DefaultText>This ancient scroll is bound with silver thread. The broken wax seal is stamped with the shape of an eye. 

The scroll at first appears to be gibberish, a collection of symbols and characters with no apparent connection between them. As you study them, however, you could swear that the characters begin to move. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, they shift and crisscross and realign, and you are able to read the text:

"A simpleton seeks out a wise man said to know the answer to every question. 

'Please,' says the simpleton, 'You have to help me. The world terrifies me. I wake each morning, and I don't know why. I make choices each day, and I don't know what will happen as a result. I go to sleep each night, and I don't know whether it will be my last.'

When the simpleton finishes, he notices that the wise man is weeping. The simpleton apologizes profusely and asks the wise man what he has said to upset him.

The wise man shakes his head and wipes the tears from his eyes. He answers, 'Some people have all the luck.'"

"Gjestr - I know that the temple baths boast great healing properties, and that your back ails you still. Still, I would ask that, if you are to indulge for the greater part of the day, you give over your key to the sanctum to someone else for safekeeping. This is not the first time we have been forced to wait to perform the day's rites, and Rectrix Obrica is often too far below to hear our knocking."

      <ID>537</ID>
      <DefaultText>The end of the Saint's War and the detonation of the Godhammer Bomb is still mourned by followers of Eothas around the world. While the conflict diminished Eothas' following in the Dyrwood, many remain faithful to the god of dawn and redemption, confident that he will one day rise again. Many followers make annual pilgrimages to shrines and temples of Eothas (or to what remains of them) on the anniversary of Saint Waidwen's death. The particulars of these vigils vary. In Readceras, they are often marked by song and by the recitation of Saint Waidwen's sermons. In the Dyrwood, where worshipers of Eothas are often persecuted, such ceremonies may involve standing in respectful silence until sunrise. It is customary for worshipers to wear armor or other articles that commemorate Eothas or his leadership through Waidwen.

This helmet bears the sunburst emblem of the Readceran army. It was likely first worn by a soldier serving in the Saint's War.</DefaultText>

In practice, however, Fulvano often claimed that his explorations proved only that the world outside of the Vailian Republics was a foul, smelly place that paled in comparison to his homeland.

This amulet is said to have belonged to Fulvano. He was a man much taken with mild superstitions, and this talisman, he said, was a source of luck. It also served more sentimental purpose, for it depicts one of the great ships commonly seen at the docks of his homeland.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The brîshalgwin, or "mind hunters," were known throughout Eir Glanfath centuries before Aedyran and Vailian animancers introduced formal scholarship on ciphers to the continent. They were respected - and feared - for their abilities to perceive soul connections.

When Aedyran colonists first settled in the Dyrwood, they quickly aroused the ire of their Glanfathan neighbors by trespassing - sometimes accidentally and sometimes intentionally - on Engwithan ruins. An orlan of the Three-Tusk Stelgaer tribe, a mute but preternaturally gifted cipher, used her abilities to monitor the border ruins and track the colonists who encroached upon them.

To aid in her investigations, the anamfath of Three-Tusk Stelgaer gave her this amulet, thought to be a relic of the Engwithans themselves. The public gift of such a revered artifact was a political move as well as a practical one, and it galvanized Glanfathan resistance to the settlers, particularly within Three-Tusk Stelgaer. It was lost, however, when the cipher was killed in a raid on a farming settlement.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Aldhelm,

I did indeed receive your recent summons (as well as the two that came before it). I'd been waiting for you to present yourself on my doorstep so that I could give you my answer in person: a firm and unwavering 'no.'

I won't help you. In fact, I relish the idea of you and your team of glorified engineers sitting in that tower, sweating over the runes I've studied for years. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than knowing that my research, which you've long disparaged, is the missing piece in your mundane little puzzle.

As you well know, it's knowledge I've always valued.

I'm just around the corner. I encourage you to find me should you wish to rehash this conversation in person.

Yours truly,
Icantha"</DefaultText>

"Clessia arrives tomorrow. The way we parted after her last visit, I didn't think she'd return. When I received the letter from Ozia, I expected the worst. The distance has been hard for her, and my focus on my research hasn't made things any easier.

Tomorrow, none of that will matter. The things we said, the things I didn't say... I'll have the chance to make it up to her. I wish we had more privacy here, but for now, that old house on the north side of Ondra's Gift is still empty."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This simple wooden ring is orange and gray, and it glows when you're not wearing it. The ring's actual history is more speculation than fact. While all sources agree that it was owned by Erol of Levi and that he acquired it after a period of exile, stories differ on the particulars of how he got it. Some say it was a gift from one of the gods, and others say it was the boon of a pact he made with a wicked power.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though never as famed as he would claim, the Vailian explorer Fulvano was known as an eccentric who wished to see the world. Where possible, he traveled by foot, wishing to gain a local's appreciation for the sights, sounds and smells of the lands he passed through. In practice, however, Fulvano often claimed that his explorations proved only that the world outside of the Vailian Republics was a foul, smelly place that paled in comparison to his homeland.

This pair of boots is said to have belonged to Fulvano, and the initials burned into the leather would seem to bear that out. Fulvano was very particular about his boots, for they had to endure a great deal of use, and they were constructed to be as hardy as their wearer. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I do not think you will ever see this, but you were right, Fulvano. We should have journeyed south together, and been safer for it. I would tolerate all the gloating in the world if I might live to hear it. I have put myself out of reach of the beasts circling below, but I am done for all the same. I do not think I will rise again. Whoever finds this - pray for me. Perhaps in the next life I shall be a trapper of wolves."</DefaultText>

These gloves are said to have belonged to Fulvano, who often found himself in need of some protection as he climbed harsh terrain or maneuvered through forests. While thick enough to provide some warmth, they are meant first and foremost to be flexible enough not to hinder delicate tasks. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This bronze spear appears to have been crafted with great care. Despite the weapon's age, the point is remarkably sharp. 
Adra details line the grip, and runes are carved into the shaft. You feel the adra core running through the weapon.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>'It seems I have no choice but to provide you with instruction. 
Raedric's forces are spread thin, and the road through the wilds to the South of Gilded Vale lies unguarded. Given these favorable circumstances, I'm sure that even you can manage to handle a peasant or two.

The archers tell me that Kolsc's men made south after their escape. If you should happen to retrieve one of their number, I may be convinced to forgive your previous mistakes.

For the last time, you are to keep clear of Defiance Bay. Know that if you cannot be trusted to acquire a useful specimen with even a modicum of discretion, I have no qualms whatsoever about using what materials I have at my disposal instead.

You skip ahead several pages.

You scan the middle of the book.

You turn to the last page.

"1. Ydit - leaves window open at night. Small house on the edge of Kindle Vale.

2. Higerto - visiting from Old Vailia, doesn't speak Aedyran. Keeps to himself, won't be missed.

3. Tirfeyst - lives in small encampment on road to Loghome. Takes solitary walks each morning at sunrise. Should be most vulnerable then.

4. Belmis - his parents leave him alone after temple services each Godandag.

5. Senlis - visits a mistress in Baelreach every third Folcsdag. Get him on the road.

Check Gilded Vale and Ondra's Gift. May find more interested parties there."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Dearest Mother and Father,

You will be pleased to hear that I've learned much already since coming to the city. There are many incredible ruins nearby, and Master Graeg has allowed me to accompany him on a number of expeditions.

I am writing to you from inside an ancient Engwithan tower. There's an entire district built up around it, but the locals have mostly left the tower untouched. They have let us set up temporary living quarters here so our work can continue uninterrupted. It is an unsettling place at times, but Master Graeg has been a constant comfort. And he is quick to remind me that the things we learn from this tower may one day help us find a cure for Waidwen's Legacy.

I'd better get some rest now. Mr. Graeg likes to get an early start to the day.

All my love,
Trindig"

      <DefaultText>The Coat of Ill Payment came into the hands of an Aedyran gambler after he won it in a game of chance. Unsure of exactly what use he'd get out of it, he took to wearing it at his games as a good luck charm. An opponent accused him of cheating and attempted to beat payment out of the gambler - only to recoil in pain after landing the first blow. The gambler realized then that the armor granted him some measure of magical protection - and decided upon a new scheme. 

The gambler would get into a game, cheat openly - or at least give the appearance of it - and then fight the angry party when matters escalated, often for higher stakes. This worked swimmingly - until he overplayed his hand, and found himself on the receiving end of more angry fists than the armor could handle. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though wealthy and well-educated, one Vailian noble found himself all but shunned by his peers. He lacked an eye for fashionable dress, and had no particular talent for debate, finding that he could not articulate any portion of his admittedly vast pool of knowledge. While his colleagues held grand debates on the intricacies of animancy, or the state of the Vailian Republics, he stood apart. 

At last, desperate, the noble turned to a local wizard, and requested a set of clothing which might elevate him above the crowd and give him opportunity to prove his wits. The result was a marvel, perfectly fitted and accentuating his features in such a way that he was immediately the center of attention. 

The nobleman soon found, however, that his plan worked too well - for it was the wizard Rundl whose name became associated with the fine clothing, and who found his work much in demand in the coming seasons.

A human hunter, showing skill with a bow and arrow beyond any before seen, caught Galawain's attention one day. Galawain proposed a bargain – if the hunter could best him in a hunting contest, Galawain would present her with armor that would bestow upon her the power of a wolf. For a week, both hunters tracked their respective quarry through the woods and, when the contest was ended, the hunter had felled the most game. True to his word, Galawain presented her with Wolf Heart, which gave her the crafty and evasive nature of its namesake.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A folk tale tells of a stag that could outwit any hunter. The beast would see his enemies approach before they ever came within sight, and outrun them easily, leaving no trail to follow. At last, a great hunter declared that he would be the one to kill the stag, for no quarry had ever eluded him before. The man set out early the next morning, vowing to return triumphant. Neither hunter nor stag, however, were ever seen again. Some claim the hunter succeeded and decided not to return, his prowess proved to the only one that mattered. Some say the hunter fell to a trick, and that the stag fled, seeking lands where it would never again be troubled by hunters. 
The crafter of this armor favors one telling of the tale, for the Husk of the Great Stag is said to have been made from that same stag's hide. Dressed in the stag's skin, the wearer is granted the beast's fleet-footed alertness, able to keep one step ahead of hidden dangers.</DefaultText>

Wildflowers grow as tall as folk, and the meadow is forever kissed by the mild sun and cooled by a gentle breeze. Clever trackers, fearless hunters, and innocents fleeing injustice are said to stumble upon the meadow, suddenly finding themselves in a place of perfect peace where streams flowing with fresh water are always close at hand and grain falls milled from the sheaf. It is a land of plenty, and it is unknown whether those who find their way to the meadow are unable to leave or whether they simply choose not to.

At the center of the meadow, a place the peoples of Ixamitl regard as the center of Eora, grows a tree bearing small, red fruit. It is said that the fruit can restore and reinvigorate even the frailest of individuals. This armor was supposedly anointed with the pulp of one of these fruits and imbued with essence from its pit.</DefaultText>

He believed that their very existence was a blasphemy against the gods and a scourge on all kith, and, having observed the creatures prowling by night and skulking in dark places, he fell prey to then-common misconceptions about their nature. He had his order create armor that shone with the light of the sun, believing them vulnerable to daylight. Unfortunately, he tested his theory in the cleansing of a crowded fampyr den, discovering too late that the light only alerted the creatures to his presence. Published research by animancers has since dispelled many of the dangerous myths surrounding the undead.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This superbly-crafted set of armor is dyed a dark maroon. The dye is uneven and splotchy, making it look like it was colored by an amateur. In a way, it was. Vengiatta Rugia ("Red Vengeance") was worn by a young Vailian woman who witnessed the murder of her family at the hands of mercenaries serving a powerful ducess. When the authorities questioned her, she pretended that trauma had erased any memory of the incident. 

Yet while she feigned shock-induced oblivion, she trained in secret. Since she couldn't wear armor or weapons without attracting attention, she took up work as a seamstress and learned to sew a sturdy garment that would protect her without garnering too much notice. She also refitted a stiletto with the handle of an awl, allowing her to carry it without raising suspicion.

By the time she began hunting her family's killers, she was quick with her stiletto and inconspicuous in her padded armor. She assassinated them one by one, each time soaking a piece of her garment in the blood of her latest victim.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When Gréf Admeth Hadret passed the "Ten Years" Treaties on the anniversary of the War of Black Trees, he outlawed the looting of Engwithan ruins. While this was a popular move among the Glanfathans - as well as the frontier villagers who frequently found themselves the subject of the tribes' vengeance - it was an unwelcome change for the traders and adventurers who had made their living selling Engwithan artifacts. 

Quite a few vendors, however, took to commissioning and selling replicas. Many fakes were so skillfully made that even scholars had difficulty distinguishing between them, and ciphers were sometimes hired to attest to the authenticity of high-value objects.

Argwes Adra ("Adra Armor") actually was taken from ruins near the Court of Bowing Ashes, but it so closely resembled two known fakes that it famously passed through Defiance Bay, Ancenze, and Selona before an animancer in Barda recognized its authenticity.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This armor was forged in honor of the Readceran monk Rugnfar, who came to believe that as long as no enemy could inflict more pain upon him than he could upon himself, he could never truly be subjugated by anyone. Conscripted by his government to quell the uprisings inspired by St. Waidwen, Rugnfar became a frightful presence on the battlefield - for every injury he sustained at the hands of an enemy, he would inflict one twice as severe, drawing strength from the pain that enabled him to fight through injuries that would've caused anyone else to collapse on the ground. He would charge his enemies covered in blood with tears in his skin from hand to foot, and his foes would shrink at the sight of him, believing as he did that it was not in their power to injure such a man.

Near the end of the rebellion, when the rebels had all but overthrown the government, Rugnfar found himself in a battle defending against St. Waidwen's main forces. Accounts claim that he was the last on his side to remain alive, and he was approached by St. Waidwen himself in the end. As the story goes, the living god looked him over and gave a slight bow, permitting him to fall upon his own blade, that he might remain free.

The armor bears many artificial scars added by the blacksmith to make its wearer as imposing as the figure that inspired it, though it wears its real scars with equal pride.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Despite popular assumption, the Sanguine Plate was not named for its blood-spattered appearance. It was originally owned by a barbarian from Rauatai, and while his combat style did frequently leave the Sanguine Plate in need of a good polishing, it was actually named in reference to the owner's jolly nature. 

He was popular around town and in the taverns of the nearby port, where he was quick to buy friends and visitors a drink and glad to hear the news from abroad. However, his seemingly inexhaustible good humor was counterweighted by a hair-trigger temper, and it was said that none who actually saw him in a bad mood lived to tell the tale.</DefaultText>

Made of scale armor to give the wearer the appearance of a dragon, Autumn Fire, like the Three-tusk Stelgaer, refuses to succumb to flames, and makes its wearer as one with the trees.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The young village of Gilded Vale was beset by a particularly territorial fire dragon in the early years of the Dyrwood's colonial period. It was believed that the beast was provoked by the construction of Raedric's Hold nearby. The first Lord Raedric cemented his popularity - and that of his house - when he gathered a dozen of his finest soldiers and slew the dragon himself.

Hirbel, the master armorsmith of House Raedric, forged this armor from the beast's scales, and Lord Raedric II famously wore it during the War of Defiance. Despite the armor's exceptional durability, the many scars and scratches testify to the use it saw during the war. 

The tree engraved on the cuisses commemorates House Gathbin, which presided over the then-erldom of Yenwood. That Lord Raedric went to battle against the erl's forces when the erl remained loyal to Aedyr was a source of great irony.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Once a simple set of scale mail worn by an elven scout of the Fisher Crane tribe, it was transformed along with its wearer. The scout and his party ambushed an expeditionary force that had ventured too far into the Thein Bog. One of the explorers, a wizard, cursed the scout with a spell that turned him into a raven. The scout survived the battle and took advantage of his new form to track the wizard back to his tower. 

When the scout broke the curse, he found that his armor retained some of the affliction's magic. Far-sighted and nearly undetectable, he broke into the wizard's tower, evading its magical defenses, and killed him in his sleep. 

The suit is black and form-fitting, and the feather-like scales grow in erratic whorls. They fall off over time only to grow back again in new patterns.</DefaultText>

He swore that he would find greater fortune than ever was bestowed upon his family. When he sought out opportunities to prove himself, however, he was often scorned - for he came from lowborn stock, and his line had achieved little of note. 
Discouraged, the lad returned home - only to find that his family, eager to see him achieve his wishes, had pooled what coin they had to commission a suit of armor that might keep him safe. The lad asked the smith to craft a set of gleaming scale armor, bright as the flashing scales of a fish and just as light and quick. He called it Pike's Pride, and while he wore it he found himself immune to whatever foul words his detractors might level at him.</DefaultText>

Woedicans, on the other hand, claim that the item is older than that, an instrument of retribution against oathbreakers originally employed by the Steel Garrote, an order of Woedican paladins devoted to the enforcement of oaths and contracts, often in mirthless fashion.

The flail itself is unique in that the spiked ball at its end was fashioned out of an incense burner, and when it sees vigorous use, the smell of incense blankets the area.

Gaun's Share is said to have been crafted by a distraught Dyrwoodan smith after the destruction of his home by a Glanfathan raiding party. Upon arriving at a neighboring settlement, the smith immediately set about his work, intending to craft a weapon suited to righting the wrongs done to his village.

      <DefaultText>This sword was once used by a paladin as an executioner's blade during a long-forgotten crusade. Over the years the paladin slew countless heretics, but as time wore on his fervor slowly turned to fear at the unending evil he saw growing in his homeland. Tired of the myopic and ineffective approach of his superiors, the paladin swore to cleanse the corruption from the hearts of his people and took it upon himself to execute any who consorted with heathens. After finding a heretic hiding within a small village, the paladin put all its inhabitants to the sword for aiding the sinner. That night the paladin woke to his sword being driven through his own chest, having been betrayed by his own men, who were guilt-ridden for their own complicity in his atrocities. 

This large sword seems to be covered in rust, but on closer inspection the brown stains on the blade are, in fact, dried blood. Apart from the size, the sword seems plain, its only ornamentation is hidden under the black leather wrapping on the ricasso, where an image of Woedica has been etched.

      <DefaultText>Saint Rumbalt was among the first of the Eothasian pilgrims to take up the Emperor's offer of resettlement in the distant territory of Readceras. A dedicated priest of the Shining God, Rumbalt was regarded as a leader in his community, known both for his unwavering dedication to his congregation and his stern vigilance against lapses in doctrine. What survives of his sermons reflects this duality, for he emphasized the redemptive power of the faith even as he warned against the dire punishments awaiting those who rejected Eothas' beneficence. 

The colonization efforts brought Eothasian settlers into direct conflict with the native orlan populations, and Rumbalt was among those credited with routing several brutal attacks upon the settlement. Ultimately, however, Rumbalt was mortally wounded during a violent raid. Witnesses claimed that upon the moment of his death, Rumbalt's body was suffused by an overwhelming burst of light, knocking the remaining orlan warriors flat or else scattering them back into the forest. 

Accounts arose of Rumbalt's final hours, describing the great miracles which were observed to have occurred during the day preceding his death. Eothas, it was said, had informed Rumbalt of his fate, and the priest accepted this gladly and without fear, for he knew that death was only the first step in his rebirth. He subsequently marked each of his final 27 hours with a miraculous act, such that his congregation would know of the gift Eothas had bestowed upon him, and continue Rumbalt's work in his stead. 

Rather than stanch the flow of Eothasian settlers, Rumbalt's death only encouraged more pilgrims to venture across the sea, eager to set their eyes upon the final resting place of Eothas' favored servant. The Hours of Saint Rumbalt was forged in dedication to this patron saint of the resettlement, and its blade is inscribed with markings counting the 27 hours before Rumbalt's passing. In such manner was the blade imbued with the saint's power. It was said that a man might kneel before the sword and know with precision the moment of his death.

      <DefaultText>A Rauatai harbormaster tired of officiating disputes between the various sailors, merchants, and pirates that daily made use of his port. The rowdy visitors caused trouble with the locals and with each other, leaving the harbormaster forever cleaning up their messes.

He was large, even for an aumaua, but soft-spoken. So he commissioned a local smith to forge the kind of sword that would do the talking for him. He took to patrolling the docks with it, relying on his own towering presence and his formidable blade to silence most arguments. He issued a mandate that any visiting sailors at port that did not conduct their business peaceably and depart with the tides would find themselves subject to his own mercenary justice. Disagreements were settled quickly and quietly after that.

      <DefaultText>A grimoire is the lifeblood of any wizard's magical repertoire. These books are painstakingly constructed with rare materials arranged in precise configurations, and are able to temporarily hold fragments of ambient soul essence, which is channeled through the book and discharged in the form of a spell.

It is a popular misconception among the uninitiated that wizards are the shapers of the magical energies they wield. In truth it is the pages of the grimoire that do the shaping. The art of wizardry is in the disciplined control and manipulation of the grimoire, with the most skilled wizards able to coax spells of maximal effectiveness and magnitude from their tomes.

Though all grimoires are limited by a finite set of pages, many accomplished wizards are known to carry several grimoires at once to handle a variety of situations.

Arrows fired from the bow, it was said, would find their way unfailingly to a vulnerable point and fell their target. 

Rather than allow the bow to be possessed by a single person, the tribe considered it a gift to be shared among all its members. One young tribeswoman, however, coveted the bow and its power, believing she might rule her own tribe if only she had the weapon for herself. One day, when given use of Persistence for the day's hunt, she endeavored to separate herself from her fellow hunters and left, taking the bow with her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The paladin Mabec was called to an ancient forest by a vivid dream. In this dream, he watched a tree grow from a seedling to the tallest tree in the forest, only to be felled by lightning strike. He saw himself placing his hand inside the hollow trunk and withdrawing a morning star of incomparable power.

Mabec rode into the forest, following his memory of the dream, only to find the great tree completely intact. Far from civilization and armed only with his sword, Mabec nevertheless began to hack at the tree trunk. It took weeks, but he was eventually able to fell the tree. 

Again, however, Mabec was confounded - he found no hollow in the trunk, nor a weapon of any kind. Undaunted, he continued to hack at the trunk, all the way to the tree's thick center ring, which he left intact. When he finished, he took the core of the tree and had it fashioned into the shaft of a morning star. He had his own blade, now as blunt as a wooden sword, melted down and reforged into the morning star's head. So powerful was Mabec's belief in the truth of his vision that the new weapon, though completely unremarkable in its materials, took on its master's zeal, and became great in its own right.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Beefloaf is a standard dish all across the Dyrwood and hundreds of families have been using the same recipe for generations. No one is quite sure how it came to be known as the 'duc's own,' but two legends are widespread. The first involves Admeth Hadret, the Dyrwood's first duc, personally making beefloaf for his captive prisoner, the Glanfathan Galven Rêgd.  The orlan was supposedly so fond of the meal that he asked for the recipe and passed it on to his kin after his release. The second, more likely, tale features an unscrupulous cook who worked for the venerable Black Hound Inn of Gilded Vale. She confided in myriad travelers that she had a recipe for the 'duc's own' beefloaf - simply her own delicious recipe - and sold it to dozens of people for outrageous prices. Each victim of the ruse went on to make their beefloaf with the 'duc's own' recipe, giving rise to the popular name.</DefaultText>

Locals claim that the dwarves of Talaneir were responsible for inventing the dish. Given the odd assembly of ingredients, often a notable feature of dwarven cuisine, many are inclined to accept the claim at face value. There are rumors that the Duc of Ozia has become fond of Pearlwood chicken, supposedly using greybreast chickens imported, live, all the way from Old Vailia to suit his particular tastes. As the dish is not yet popular in the Vailian Republics, the citizens of Ozia are not sure if they should try to emulate the duc's rumored style or vigorously deny it to foreigners.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Not actually a proper lance but rather a pike, the weapon was gifted to an orlan maid along with a goat by her wizard master Kabrindo, who was forced to show her the door after a number of episodes of remarkable clumsiness and brash carelessness that had left his grimoire waterlogged and his laboratory in ashes. The gifts were all the soft-hearted wizard could do to stanch his guilt.

Wandering from place to place with only her goat, her pike, and a reputation for negligence that preceded her, her fortunes changed one day when she encountered a pair of soldiers trapped by a group of bandits. Too short to wield the pike properly, she instead climbed atop her goat and spurred it into the fray, leveling the pike like a lance and running one of the bandits through. Frightened and confused by the display and intimidated by Jêna's coarse language, the remaining bandits fled, and the soldiers' lives were spared.

Her actions earned her a commission with a local fort, and she served with distinction in the cavalry. The original experience had given her such pleasure that she always found a place at the front of any charge. Eventually, this took its toll, and she went missing after her unit was commanded to charge a group of trolls.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lost Thayn's Reach was once wielded by Thayn Solmar Cyneheod of The Grasp. While engaged in a skirmish against some Glanfathan rebels at the outskirts of New Heomar, Solmar cornered their leader at the edge of a cliff. The rebels quickly interposed themselves between Thayn Solmar and their leader, seeking to prevent Solmar from striking the final blow. 

A skilled pikeman, Solmar was able to foul every effort to strike him, and he ultimately dealt the rebel leader a mortal wound. Unfortunately, the pike's hooked blade became snagged upon the dying elf's armor, pulling Solmar over the edge of the cliff with his foe. </DefaultText>

This is a terrible weapon that disappoints anyone who uses it. The gun appears well-made at first glance, but closer scrutiny reveals poor design and shoddy craftsmanship. Those who aren't fooled by its appearance still occasionally attempt to use it just to see if maybe the whole thing was made to look this way as an elaborate ruse, hoping that it is an artifact of extreme power, crafted by a master who desired to conceal its remarkable nature.

Ygendurl's troops, beaten and shattered by Hadret's forces, knew they were on the losing side of the war. Ygendurl called for parley and struck an accord - his soldiers would take up arms for Hadret in return for clemency. Ygendurl then turned his weapon and his remaining forces upon his former allies, flanking them as they focused their attention upon Hadret. Caught unawares, the Imperial forces suffered terrible losses during the ensuing chaos.

Despite his efforts, neither Ygendurl nor his troops lived to see the end of the war. His infamy, however, survives, and he is not fondly remembered by those on either side of the conflict.</DefaultText>

High master of the school was an elven mage known as Taluntain, who became aware of a growing problem - the aura cast by the school's particular magic was like a beacon to the unsavory creatures of the surrounding area. Marauding trolls from the nearby moors assailed its walls regularly. The high master resolved to take action, and in his study he crafted a fearsome staff to incinerate the trolls.

As much as that seemed important at the time, the demanding and short-tempered Taluntain soon became preoccupied with other uses he'd discovered for his staff, namely in the punishment of unruly students, and that would become its predominant function in the ensuing years.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A Readceran fairy tale tells of a blacksmith who was traveling through the woods on his way home from a distant village. The wheel of his wagon broke and he had to make camp and repair it. During the night, a pack of hunting stelgaers ventured into his encampment, and he hid among the trees. Just as one of the beasts picked up his scent, a delemgan stepped out of the copse and in front of the blacksmith.

The stelgaers soon lost interest, and when the blacksmith had recovered from his terror, he thanked the delemgan, Vierina, and begged to know how he could express his gratitude. Thrice she bade him forget about her and continue on his way, but seeing the man's zeal, she finally relented. 

"Enemies encroach on my wood," she said. "Bring me a means of defending it." The blacksmith swore that he'd return with a worthy gift and so departed. Weeks later, he forged a dagger and sought her in the forest. She saw the gift and smiled sadly. 

"A noble attempt, yet I fear it would do little to clear the foes that spring up in my midst. Please, return home and know that you have my thanks for your efforts." But the blacksmith shook his head and, over her protests, promised to bring her a suitable gift.

After months behind the forge, he'd crafted several fine battle axes, and he brought the best of these to Vierina. Even her graciousness did not conceal the horror on her face. "Surely my enemies would seize this and turn it against me and my forest. Please, go to your village and forget about this." But, deaf to her objections, he vowed to try again.

So the blacksmith devoted a year to crafting the finest, sharpest spearheads any had seen. People came from near and far to purchase the very weapons that he had crafted, finished, and deemed unworthy of Vierina. And as his reputation grew, so did the village around him. After a year of labor, he returned to the forest with the finest spear any had ever seen. The wilds seemed to have dwindled, and finding her was no easy task. When he eventually did, he presented the spear. "A weapon worthy of you," he said. "Long enough that none may snatch it from your grasp."

But she recoiled from the wooden pole. "I could not defend myself with the bones of my own felled trees. I beg you, go and do not return." Yet he made an oath to bring her a final gift to fit her purposes.

After years of work, he crafted the finest rapier in the land, its blade as narrow and fine as a needled leaf. In that time, the sale of his lesser attempts had made him a wealthy man, and his village had grown to a small city. When he returned to the forest a final time, he hardly recognized it. The sprawling woodlands had been whittled to a few scrubby thickets, and Vierina was nowhere to be found. He returned once again to his forge and spent the rest of his days making rapiers to wreak vengeance upon Vierina's unknown tormentors.

      <DefaultText>At the beginning of Waidwen's Legacy, a cleric of Berath in New Heomar petitioned his god to end the Hollowborn curse. He knelt on the stone floor of his temple and prayed for five days straight, forsaking food, water, and sleep for the sake of his vigil. On the evening of the fifth day, he fell into an exhausted slumber and dreamt that the Pallid Knight told him to restore the cycle by returning the souls of the living to it. When he awoke, he found a large but plain candlestick from the temple altar lying next to his hand.

He fashioned the candlestick into a weapon, and he prowled the city, murdering the elderly and the infirm in Berath's name. As the death toll climbed into the dozens, a mob of the vengeful and bereaved formed to track him down. They caught up with the cleric outside his temple and turned his own weapon on him, bashing his skull apart in the streets. Several onlookers claimed to see an elderly dwarf, cloaked and impossibly emaciated, standing in the shadows and laughing.</DefaultText>

Certain that wolves or mountain lions were to blame, the townsfolk set up a nightly watch to stop the beasts.

During one night's vigil, the town awoke to screams of pain and terror. They found the farmer on watch in the middle of a field, one shoulder a bloody stump, a horrific gul leaning over him. The gul saw the townspeople and fled, still gnawing on the wounded farmer's right arm.

They got the farmer back to his house, and the healer did her best to repair the damage. When asked what had happened, all the farmer could manage was something that sounded like, "Pretty... pretty..." The gul came to be known as Pretty Pretty, and the villagers searched for someone to defeat it. Their cries for help were answered by a necromancer who kept a rib from the gul and had it made into a rod.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In a monastery overlooking Coldflow Lake from the foothills of the White March, there once resided a clandestine order of monks known as the Thousand Dreams. Through a powerful form of pain-induced meditation, these monks were able to walk through their past lives as though they were dreams. Each traversed these memories in ultimate hopes of achieving complete understanding of his or her soul's identity. They believed that after experiencing one thousand lifetimes, total enlightenment could be attained.

Greatest of their sect was Rî Golan, who had an ancient soul and was said to have walked more lifetimes than any other. But when she came to the end of all her lifetimes and found there was no more to experience, it became clear that she would never come to know herself completely, for there was simply not enough to learn from. 

Unable to accept this fate after her endless trials, Rî Golan sought a way to take the experiences of others for her own, that she might reach one thousand lifetimes yet. She channeled her unquenchable hunger into her favorite sword, and it became an instrument of her will. With it, she claimed many lives in the surrounding area. Each drop of blood on her blade was a new experience, each killing blow a new lifetime for her to claim. 

When the rest of the Thousand Dreams came to learn of her actions, they banded together and confronted Rî Golan upon her return to the temple. In the end, amid a courtyard of slain monks, she did indeed come to understand her soul, and it is said that among the many experiences contained in the blade are all those of Rî Golan herself.

The blade itself is a simple sabre with a worn leather grip and an inset ebony hilt. The sword becomes hot to the touch when its wielder's foes are vanquished.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It has been alleged that the sabre Resolution can be traced back to an ancient line of warriors predating the formation of the Aedyr Empire, though the legitimacy of the claim has always been in dispute. What is known is that the sabre has been passed down through generations of Yenwood erls, having accompanied them across the sea during the colonization of the Dyrwood. The sabre was held as a symbol of their noble lineage, and most formal portraits of the family include the blade in some respect. 

It was the youngest of the line who endeavored to repair the weapon so that it might serve more than ornamental purpose. The blade was reforged into a weapon that struck hard and true, and the young erl wielded it during his efforts to reclaim the keep of Caed Nua, traditional stronghold of the Erl of Yenwood. Both sword and bearer were lost, never to be seen again. 

Several missions were undertaken to retrieve the weapon when the War of Defiance arose, but none met with any success.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This sabre has posed a mystery to historians and weaponsmiths for two centuries. It was recovered from an Engwithan ruin, but almost all experts agree that it is far younger than any of the artifacts left by that ancient civilization. Yet no one has been able to explain the runes on the blade, which are unmistakably Engwithan. The one fact on which all have agreed is that it is a formidable, if poorly-understood, weapon.</DefaultText>

An important Glanfathan landmark, Dev Clef was the site of a brutal battle between the Glanfathans and Dyrwoodans during the tumultuous period before the Ten Years' Treaties were signed. The crags and caves along the cliffs provided the Glanfathans with plentiful cover from which to stage their attacks against Dyrwoodan forces, allowing them to duck out of sight the moment a threat emerged. Given this natural advantage, the Glanfathans succeeded in driving the Dyrwoodans from the region.</DefaultText>

Well aware of his failings, his family crafted him a shield of exceptional heft and durability, trusting that if he could not rain blows upon his enemies, he might at least prevent them landing any upon him in turn. 

The shield proved effective in this regard, for Ilfan was so thoroughly obscured by the shield, even while lying dazed in the mud, that many enemies sought out new targets out of sheer frustration.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This simple wooden buckler would not be out of place in a pile of surplus training shields. Painted green, it has two black iron straps across its front that form a large "X." It looks like it has taken more than its share of blows and may have been in use for far too long. But far from ordinary, the buckler is in fact thousands of years old, its preservation a testament to a transcendence of its humble creation.

The buckler originally belonged to one of the founding members of the Darcozzi Paladini when she was just a squire, thousands of years ago in the glory days of Old Vailia. As it accumulated damage from war and weather, the buckler became an extension of the paladin's own irrepressibility and protectiveness, as well as a symbol that inspired those in her charge. She wore it in every battle of her long and distinguished career, and though the paladin's name would eventually succumb to the ravages of time, the shield has yet to do the same.

It is said the shield was so partial to its original master that it will allow none but a paladin of similar conviction to touch it, and in times of need it has a way of making it into the hands of those whose souls mirror the greatest qualities of the Darcozzi founder. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Stolen from the table of ogre matron Sura by Ferron Dulca after he infiltrated her compound to assassinate her, Sura's Supper Plate became the assassin's running joke. In the moment of his triumph, Ferron pulled the iron plate from under the matron's lifeless head and held it up like a shield. Thinking himself quite clever, he took the plate and several of Sura's eating utensils to a local blacksmith and had a shield fashioned from them. 

The sharp blades protruding from the front of the shield proved an excellent deterrent against foes at close range, and Ferron took to wielding it regularly - until he lost his shield, his arm, and his life to Sura's daughter. </DefaultText>

They are thought to have been the weapon of choice of a fallen military state, though their origins have not been traced to any particular culture of the period.

They are prized among soldiers for the quickness they lend to one's strikes.

      <DefaultText>The War of Black Trees brought hardship and suffering to many Glanfathans, but it bore special tragedy for its druidic orders, who were forced not only to endure the deaths of many friends and kin, but also the destruction of the lands they revered above all else. Among these was Azureith, a young Ovate. 

Deeply troubled by the use of the elements to turn nature against the people of Eir Glanfath, and wondering if he was seeing the last days of his people, Azureith took to walking the endless stretches of burned down forests in search of something, anything, that might signal a reason to hope. He found it in an old ironwood tree, thick and gnarled with roots that ran in waves through the ground as though they'd been woven there. It stood as it always had, though singed well up the side of its trunk now, while everything around it had been incinerated by the soldiers of Dyrwood, leaving a wasteland a thousand acres in every direction.

Azureith plucked a single branch from the old tree (making sure to express his profound gratitude). An accomplished organic artificer, Azureith reshaped the branch into a blade that would rival any made in a forge. He infused it with the strength of the elements, vowing never again to be at their mercy, and resolving that if the tree could endure, so, too, could he. 

In his hands, the blade would find its way into the hearts of many soldiers who stood at the edge of forests with torches and barrels of pitch, and by the war's end, he had saved many forests from the flame.

When his years were drawing to a close, Azureith made a final pilgrimage back to the old ironwood tree, which still stood, and he laid the knife at its base, to be taken up by someone else in need of inspiration in dark times. On his way there, he was pleased to see that beneath the ashes that covered the forest floor, new life had begun to spring.

Azureith's Stiletto is unusual as the entire weapon is dark red-brown wood, even the blade. The magic used in its creation hardened and protected the wood, preventing it from chipping or warping. Dark green vines and leaves sprout from it and wrap themselves around the hilt to form the grip. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Oidhreacht once belonged to a prominent military instructor in the capital city of Aedyr. The instructor was a cipher whose gifts were seldom used by his empire, and he grew frustrated at his superiors' inability to see the potential of ciphers to perform key missions that no other force would be capable of. He began making his opinion known, and over time the opinion became more subversive and radical, until at last his unsanctioned activities got him charged with treason.

The officer and crew that came to detain him, however, underestimated him as much as the empire had, and with only this blade and the talents of his mind, he slew his would-be captors. He fled the city and embarked on a life as a duelist, obsessed with proving his potential to any who would question it. In the end his life ended in the manner that the lives of duelists typically do, and the potential he often spoke of would remain just that.

The knife still bears his psychic imprint, and the wielder will often get flashes of the maneuvers the original owner performed in order to deliver the killing blow to his opponent. Some regard this as a curse, but many find value in it, and use such experiences to better realize the knife's potential.

Were it not for evidence of heavy use about the handle and pommel, Oidhreacht would seem new, its cutting edge perfectly beveled and honed without a single nick along its length.</DefaultText>

When she awoke, she saw the fingers of her left hand stricken with a numbing corruption. As she journeyed back in the direction of her village, she watched the corruption spread along her knuckles and across her hand. Unwilling to succumb to it, she took her stiletto and cut off her hand at the wrist.</DefaultText>

Such was the sword's influence upon the morale of the troops that on the occasion that the soldier nearly succumbed to a hail of Glanfathan arrows, prompting a swift retreat, a frustrated commander decided that the sword should have a new name - for it seemed to be what determined if they achieved shame or glory. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A legend of the Living Lands speaks of a marvelous and dangerous garden watched over by four guardians - Northern Wind, Southern Gale, Western Sun, and Eastern Moon. To protect the garden from those who would disturb its wonders, and to protect hapless wanderers from the ravenous beasts and carnivorous plants within, the guardians diverted travelers with their respective domains - frigid and buffeting winds, glaring daylight, and the darkness of night. Three would stand alert each season while one guardian rested. 

It is said that Northern Wind left this sword sheathed in the mountain snows each year during its autumn respite.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Cgadob was a wizard and wand-maker. Though brilliant, he had trouble selling his work due to a number of eccentricities, not the least of which was a vow that he would never make two wands of the same color. The hazel wand was one of his most powerful creations. Unfortunately, like everything he made, it was the only one of its kind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An old Glanfathan legend tells of a young woman who loved a wanderer from a distant land. In time he was forced to travel back to his homeland, but he promised to return. Years passed with no word from her love, and the woman fell into a depression, neither eating nor speaking. Even in the depths of winter, she refused to abandon hope, keeping faithful watch for her beloved by the shore where she had last laid eyes upon him. Finally, she succumbed to her grief, and her heart froze upon the moment of her death, her tears becoming ice upon her cheeks. 

Her grieving family buried her within a nearby glade, and from her grave a strange elm tree grew. Its bark was the white of a winter snowfall, its leaves blue and cold to the touch. It never lost its foliage in the winter, withstanding even the bitterest temperatures. 

This wand is said to have been hewn from that very elm, for it too emanates the chill of a broken heart.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The dwarven clan of Langmyhr dwelt in the wilds of Naasitaq, hunting game and surviving off of the harsh land. Summers were brief and winters difficult, but the winter of 2562 AI was one of the hardest in the tribe's long history. A mighty snow leopard had established territory nearby, scaring off much of the game near the village. By Fonauton, the hunters were returning with little more than rabbits, and the winter freeze was nigh. A dozen of the best hunters stuck out across the tundra, determined to hunt the great cat.

The beast was craftier than they'd planned, and by Inivèrno, half of the hunters and most of their hunting foxes had been slain without so much as wounding the leopard. Desperate and furious, one of the hunters crafted a bow from the bones of her slain fox. As her remaining companions looked on, it seemed that all of her rage was channeled into the weapon while she carved and shaped it. Her work completed, she set off and tracked the beast to its lair. Once she'd killed it, she decorated her bow with its teeth as a reminder of the deed and of the long and tragic hunt.

Now black with age and use, this bow is nevertheless fierce to behold. It's studded with the teeth of a large cat, and the notches curve in tight spirals. </DefaultText>

His raids were carried out at the start of stormy weather, and gathering clouds were often feared as much as heralds of his arrival as of the storms they promised. The force behind his shots would carry his arrows up beyond the cloud cover, and they were said to bring the power they met there back down to the sea with them, striking all below with the force of a lightning bolt. </DefaultText>

Shatterstar was a hammer forged from a solid block of pallasite that was discovered by one of Eothas' faithful shortly after Saint Waidwen rose to power in Readceras. It was crafted into a weapon and carried at the head of the Readceran army during Waidwen's march on the Dyrwood. As such, it was believed lost at the Godhammer Citadel.

The head of the hammer is iron and nickel laced with yellow and orange crystals. It's held in place by a bronze band joined to softly jingling rings.</DefaultText>

The boots disappeared and were not seen again for years. An elven rogue by the name of Tahlvia came across the Cat's Whisper boots in Goodhope and "liberated" them from their owner. But, as fate would have it, Tahlvia lost the boots somewhere in the mountains of White March.

These boots rise to the knee and are made of a soft leather dyed a dark shade of blue-violet. Small brass buttons stud the outer sides.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Malina was born to Glamfellen travelers in the Dyrwood but returned to her ancestral village in the White that Wends after her parents passed away. When a migratory clan stopped in her village, the elder's son tried to defile her, and she blinded him with a torch. Knowing the young man would rally his friends to hunt her down and that her own village could offer little protection, Malina fled but got hopelessly lost in the midst of a snowstorm. 

Frightened, hungry, and knowing the hunters were close behind, she came across a pool in the shape of a giant hoof print, filled with a liquid that shimmered like ice. Muttering a prayer to Rymrgand, she dipped her boots into it, and the strange substance infused her boots with a magic that hastened her escape and erased her tracks.

Hoping to start a new life, Malina traveled to Eir Glanfath two months later only to be killed by an orlan brîshalgwin in the War of Black Trees.

The boots are made of a rough, reddish-brown leather. The left side of the left boot is branded with a stylized image of a walrus.

Drawing instead on some of the same research that his colleagues had used to preserve essence in necrotized flesh and bone, he imbued these boots with magic that would bolster the wearer's vitality for a few additional seconds. While the extra time is rarely enough to finish a battle, it's allowed more than one lucky adventurer to seek emergency healing instead of falling unconscious or dead.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>These boots bear the rising sun of Eothas, and they were first worn by a footsoldier in Saint Waidwen's army. The daughter of poor vorlas farmers, she was sickly and frail all of her life. Yet such was her devotion to Eothas that, when the Readceran army marched on the Dyrwood, she set off to join them against her family's warnings, traveling all the way to the White March on her own. 

When she finally arrived at the army's camp, it is said that Saint Waidwen himself came out to greet the young woman, blessing her for her courage and endurance. Her boots were branded with the emblem of his army, and she continued across the mountains with the troops. 

She disappeared, however, after the detonation of the Godhammer. Historians and folklorists disagree on whether she died in the explosion, remained in the Dyrwood, or met another fate on her way back to Readceras, but her boots somehow remained behind. Eothas' faithful often maintain that she ascended with the god himself at the end of the war, leaving only the shoes that had served her so faithfully.</DefaultText>

Even others in the priesthood scoffed at her recklessness, and yet she was never felled in battle. The most furious onslaughts of her enemies only seemed to revitalize her, and she was a very old woman when she finally passed in her sleep.</DefaultText>

Upon seeing the atrocity, Elayna abandoned all rational thought and ran screaming toward Terwyn's castle, first in anguish, then in rage. To the surprise of all present, Elayna suddenly stopped screaming and burst into flames, supposedly touched by Magran herself. Terwyn's soldiers loosed their arrows, but Elayna didn't even slow. She struck the castle gates like a battering ram, bursting through and scattering Terwyn's soldiers. Desperate to escape her fury, those who remained threw their master into her path. Her flames engulfed him, and no one knows if the unearthly scream that followed came from him or from her, but within minutes, both of them had burnt to ashes - only these bracers survived.

These bracers are made of bronze covered in a dark green patina. Etched into the metal is a picture of a slender humanoid engulfed in flames. Strangely enough, the humanoid has no head, only two blue orbs where the eyes would normally be.</DefaultText>

Panicked, Gyrges ran into the Bael Marsh, but his pursuers easily followed his tracks. An archer shot him as he attempted to swim across the Bael River.

However, a skilled thief later pilfered the gloves and, prudently, disappeared without a trace.

      <DefaultText>Rabbit fur gloves appeared in Aedyran fables and bedtime stories for hundreds of years, typically as lucky gifts to individuals of particular virtue. 
 
The gloves were first mentioned in a bedtime story about a girl who, in the midst of a famine, gave a piece of fruit to an elderly crone. The old woman in turn gave rabbit fur gloves to the girl, and though it was summer, she accepted them graciously. She wore them and managed to forage enough to feed her family, and a few short seasons later, she became a hunter of uncanny skill. 

In other stories, the gloves are given to brave warriors, hard-working servants, and honest shopkeepers. The last story to mention the gloves is that of the notorious pickpocket Sanduran, who lost them when he stole an apple from a wizened old crone.

Although the gloves appear to be sewn from the fur of different rabbits, there is no detectable seam between the many-colored pelts. They're soft and cozy, yet when you put your hands in them, your fingers still feel quick and nimble. A rabbit's foot dangles from the left glove, and their natural warmth suggests the presence of essence.</DefaultText>

Aedyran wizards and animancers took a particular interest in this piece, particularly when an imperial Watcher claimed to see the soul of the forests of the Dyrwood within it. However, when one of the wizards studying the amulet was driven mad, research ground to a halt. The artifact changed hands, and it was believed to have been stolen back by a Glanfathan rogue.

It is said that, unable to get out, some of the souls have lost their sanity, while others formed a unique collective consciousness that kept the memory and talents of each alive. Those who wear it will swear they hear voices talking to them, guiding their actions.

The locket is scratched and inlaid with simple nielloed patterns. The crown base is decorated with a stylized bear head. Upon opening the locket, you see a six-sided crystal that appears dark at first. However, as you gaze into it, it warms with an orange glow.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Young Talino Keal and his father were ambushed by vithrack whilst on their way to Twin Elms. Before the child even registered the strange arachnids, his father thrust something into his hands and told him to run. 

As he turned to flee, the creatures blasted him with psionic energy. Talino's mind reeled, nearly overcome by the insidious power. Suddenly, he was pulled back to his immediate surroundings. Half sprinting, half stumbling away from the vithrack and his stricken father, Talino made it to the edge of town before he collapsed. The town guards were baffled at how the child had withstood the attack. 

The item his father had given him was an old silver medallion. It was badly worn and missing its chain, and the words "Do not yield to fear" were barely visible upon its surface. As soon as he came of age, Talino joined the personal guard of a local thayn. When he did, he strung it on a thin silver chain and commissioned a priest to enchant the medallion with additional protective wards. Talino went missing years later whilst on an expedition in the White March.</DefaultText>

Upon the performer's death, it was discovered that a silver torque with a shimmering green stone had been imbued with a piece of the dancer's soul, allowing some of his or her legendary skill to live on. Given Dream Dancer's slender build and reclusiveness, it was never truly known whether this renowned artist was a man or woman.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This small drinking horn was commissioned by a group of road wardens who, after many dangerous journeys through the Living Lands, decided they needed something to commemorate their past adventures and steel themselves for new ones.

Some believe that an entire set of these horns was created. Chanters of the Living Lands tell stories of men and women taking swigs from these horns only to charge headfirst into battle, shouting elaborate insults about the ancestry of their enemies. But if other horns exist, none have been found.

Bound to a leather strap, the horn is encircled by verdigris-encrusted scale bands and is engraved along one side. Most of the script has long since worn off, but the words "...used with moderation" remain.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A Dyrwoodan legend tells the story of a hunter who spent days in the woods, trying to find food for her family. In her first trap, she caught a boar. "Please, great hunter," the boar begged when she approached, "I am no ordinary boar. I am the ruler of my kind. If you free me, I will reward you greatly!" So the hunter freed the boar, who ran off laughing, never to be seen again. 

Her second trap caught a turkey. "Please, powerful hunter," the turkey said when she approached, "I am no ordinary turkey! I am the ruler of my kind. If you free me, you will get rewards such that you cannot imagine." So the hunter released the turkey, who also ran off laughing, never to be seen again. 

The final trap held a fox. "Please, mighty hunter," the fox began as she approached. "I will not free you," said the hunter. "Already I have lost two wonderful meals. I will not lose a third. If you truly will reward me, then I will free you, but you must leave something of yours behind so I know you will return" So the fox left behind the length of its legs, enchanting the hunter's cape with its grace and reflexes. The fox returned to its kind but was rejected for its short-legged appearance. "You look like a dog!" her fellows taunted. No longer welcome among her kind, the fox returned to the hunter and offered another deal: she would aid the hunter in all endeavors as payment for her life. This cloak represents the bargain between the fox and the hunter.

Weathered and worn, this cloak is tan with light splotches. When pulled over the head, the corners look like erect dog ears.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Cloaks of Many Feathers are assembled over several generations. In the same way that some orlan followers of Hylea are known to devour birds to steal their songs, the members of the orlan clans near Maiden Falls have developed a coming-of-age ritual for young hunters.

To prove his or her prowess, each young hunter was tasked with tracking one of the great eagles of the nearby mountains and retrieving a feather. The collected feathers were woven into a cloak, which would either be bestowed on the most skilled hunter in the tribe or, on rare occasions, given to honored allies. 

A few silver pinions are scattered among the red, black, and brown feathers of the cloak. The overall pattern brings to mind autumn foliage. It feels light on your shoulders.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The rough texture and faded color of this cloak suggest that it is ancient. The symbols and runes along the edges indicate Engwithan origins.
 
Scholars of Engwithan culture have translated an old story about a father driven mad with grief by the death of his son. He entered a permanent state of mourning, donning the traditional garb of the bereaved and locking himself in his keep. The story suggests that he performed horrific experiments upon the living in an effort to resurrect his dead son. His mourning clothes were said to be infused with power as a result of these experiments.

'Eadnung, the bright star, spoke, and her voice was like a clarion cry, calling his soul forth. He knew her for the Right Hand of the Shining God, and was afraid. 

"O Wanderer, hear me," she spoke. "You are known to us, and your deeds put you far from salvation." And he wept, for he knew that his sins lay bare before this great illumination.

Then Sargamis spoke, and his voice swept forth with the heat and force of the bright day's sun. "Weep not, for the Child of Light has forgiveness even for you, if you will embrace Him." 

Harmke knelt before them, then, resolved to save himself, and asked what he must do.

And Modegund spoke. Her voice was like the songbird's final hymn, bidding farewell to the day's light. "What darkness lies within you, you must cast into His light. Your sins will be burned from you, until you are newly formed, reborn into His keeping." 

So spoke Modegund, but Eadnung warned him, saying, "You have walked all these years into darkness, and must now return. You will find the path like treading fire, and at every step you will be tempted to turn away. But no harm will come to you, if you keep your faith." '</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The most famous battle of the Saint's War, other than the one that took place at Halgot Citadel, was the sack of Mercy Vale. 

While the main force of Saint Waidwen's army marched on the Dyrwood from the north, two brigades approached from the east, reaching Cold Morn from a pass through the White March. The villagers of Cold Morn allowed the Readcerans to continue unopposed, an act of cowardice that still draws curses from Dyrwoodans today. The soldiers headed north, planning to join the rest of the army at New Yarma. 

The villagers of Mercy Vale had little warning and no time to prepare, but they fought to hold the Readcerans back as long as they could. Though the town was burned to the ground after a few days of fighting, the delay allowed the villages and tribes on the way to New Yarma to organize successful guerrilla campaigns. It's widely believed that the battle at Mercy Vale, as well as the many skirmishes in the wilds, kept the Readcerans from reaching Halgot Citadel before the Godhammer was in place.

When survivors and family members eventually returned to see what was left of Mercy Vale, this cloak was one of the only items that had escaped the flames. Completely undamaged, it draped the corpse of a warrior who'd fallen in the middle of town, the body so covered in wounds that identification was impossible.</DefaultText>

Strungbr was determined to extend the period in which he could cast himself into a fearless frenzy, for it was the means by which he survived most of his many battles. The animancer, in turn, was much intrigued by the opportunity to investigate the affliction of temper. Over a period of time, the trigger for Strungbr's rage was isolated, and the belt was imbued with a spell which mimicked the effect. The resulting damage done to the laboratory ensured that the pair never collaborated again, but Strungbr was very pleased with the belt he received. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Commissioned by a wealthy nobleman in New Heomar, this leather belt has been dyed to resemble the felines for which it is named. Much taken by accounts of the fearsome beasts, the eccentric nobleman gathered pelts and hunting trophies, though he had never seen any of the creatures in person. When commissioning this belt, the nobleman insisted upon an enchantment which would grant him the stelgaer's grace and poise. Despite these mundane origins, the enchantment proved very effective. While the belt won't guarantee that the wearer will land on their feet after a fall, it will see them back in fighting stance more quickly. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The story goes that this ring belonged to the Seeker of Balance, a cipher assassin of the Order of the Black Stone. He was captured in an attempt to kill a ducess in Old Vailia, and while awaiting execution, he channeled his soul into the ring. The ring was then taken by one of the guards who, upon wearing it, was possessed by the Seeker. Through the guard, he completed the assassination of the ducess. Over the years, the ring lost its power to possess but remained a formidable item.

This tarnished old ring isn't much to look at. By night, however, the mark of the Order of the Black Stone glows from the band.</DefaultText>

The ring adjusts to the finger of the wearer, but removing it can be a painful experience, as the roots bond to flesh.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Once belonging to the wife of a noted animancer known as Snerf, this white-gold wedding ring is set with a central pink stone flanked by two small diamonds. The shine of the gems stands in stark contrast to the grimy, worn band. It is rumored that while his love was ill and on the brink of death, the desperate animancer performed a radical experiment to merge her soul with his. 

According to most versions of the tale, her already weakened body was unable to withstand the strain of the binding. While this process extinguished the little life left in her body, it overwhelmed her soul, fragmenting it into oblivion. Overcome with guilt and despair, the once-great man lived out the last of his days in a svef-induced madness, holding onto the hope that he might somehow glimpse traces of her soul amongst his own pitiful reflection.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An elven wizard of Aedyr, Telda was forever frustrated by the limits of her own considerable powers. After spending almost two centuries mastering most of the spells known to kith, she found that her greatest challenge lay not with her repertoire, but with her inability to make more frequent use of her magic.

She spent the last century of her life studying a means to amplify her abilities. When at last she developed the spell she needed, she had it built into this ring so that the prudent wizard need not cast the spell to make use of it.</DefaultText>

When Dunryd Row was founded fifteen years later, she was one of the first ciphers to join. Though relatively old for an orlan, she was one of its most enthusiastic and capable agents. Known as the "Dunryd Demon," she was ruthlessly methodical and infamous throughout Defiance Bay for prowling the streets in her helmet, searching for clues and connections. At the end of the Saint's War, she was over forty, and she was sent to the Godhammer Citadel to search for traces of Saint Waidwen. She never arrived, and years later, her helmet was found on the road from Echo Bay.</DefaultText>

The prince and his court were known for their outlandish dress but not, unfortunately, for prowess in battle. In fact, when the prince learned that the Aedyran army was marching toward him, he threw a fabulous party to welcome the invaders. 

This hat survived the war and subsequent occupation and has been traded in many a dark corner by those wishing to further their social standing with panache.

Lined with garish purple silk and adorned with a large, chartreuse feather, the hat makes a strong, if questionable, fashion statement.

      <ID>1504</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Little could one know that the man who once destroyed part of his own country with fire would become the Dyrwood's most beloved leader. Martyred in the war he started to free his people from an oppressive rule, there isn't a Dyrwoodan who doesn't know of or revere Admeth for what he did.

Strangely, even though there are records of his father Edrang's childhood, and even though he was raised in nobility in the Dyrwood (while it was still Aedyre territory), information about Admeth's early years is nearly impossible to find. Admeth is not known for his childhood, though. He is known for saving the Dyrwood and uniting it with its sworn enemy - the Glanfathans.

In 2652 AI the Dyrwoodan troubles with their fercönyng were at a boiling point. Several of the erls under Edrang's rule, provoked by the imperial court in Aedyr resumed looting the ruins around Dyrwood that the Glanfathans held sacred. When the Glanfathans finally retaliated, it was overwhelmingly brutal and resulted in a slave uprising. Galven Regd, whom Edrang had fought before, resumed control of the Glanfathan troops. Regd was also able to convince some delemgan to join the fight.

Edrang was, at this point, far too old to lead his forces into battle, so he sent his son Admeth in his place to contain the threat. Admeth, true to form as the son of Edrang, and obviously having learned tactics from his father, made a dangerous, but effective, tactical decision. In order to prevent Regd's troops from using the woods as cover and to keep them from advancing through his land, set fire to the forest at tributary of the Isce Uar River and positioned his troops to prevent any of the Glanfathan forces from retreating. This tactic proved to be effective - while some Glanfathans and delemgan were able to escape, thousands died. In the skirmish that followed, Galven Regd was captured and sent to be held New Heomar. Admeth was able to do what his father spent decades trying to do. He stopped Galven Regd.

The conflict with the Glanfathans continued for several months, and Admeth repeated the scorched earth tactic several times to flush the opposing forces from key battlefields. He was able to bring the conflict to and end before the year ended. While it was a win for the Dyrwoodans, it was very costly as well. Because of his tactics, the conflict earned the name The War of Black Trees.

After Edrang's death in 2654, Admeth became the Gréf of the Dyrwood to the dismay of the imperial court and the other erls. Over the course of the next year, they defied his rule at every turn, rebuking his decrees and countermanding his directives. 

In 2655 AI, Admeth had had enough. Even though he lacked support from most of the erls, he was admired by both the Vailian ducs and all the common folk. Backed by this support, he issued an ultimatum to the fercönyng  to anoint him a gréf palatine. The fercönyng, unwilling to deal with a rebellion while trying to establish a new vorlas trade in Readceras, agreed. 

Admeth then held authority and legal power over the erls, their holdings, and their titles. The Dyrwood was no longer a gréfram, but instead was a palatinate. This change reduced the fercönyng's power over the region. 

With his new power, Admeth quickly brought the rebellious erls into line. But, in exchange for the power, Admeth invested time and money into all of the Dyrwood's ports and trade posts, dramatically increasing shipping traffic. This helped the erls and brought in more money for the fercönyng."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Aedyr is a country rich with custom and they are known for their strict adherence to them. Their customs run the gamut from grand celebrations - like the Feast of Feasts - to mundane superstitions - such as ways to avoid svef addiction. This volume will focus primarily on bigger celebrations, as no one knows how to throw an extravagant party quite like an Aedyran.

The Feast of Feasts

The biggest and most important of all Aedyran customs is the Feast of Feasts. This week-long celebration happens the first week of Fonestu (Deep Summer) and is dedicated to honoring the life of the First Fercönyng. Each day of the week is devoted to some aspect of the fercönyng's life and there are very specific dishes to be served at each meal. 

The Feast of Feasts originally began as a festival celebrating the birth of the fercönyng's first son and soon became a yearly occurrence during the week of his birthday. Currently, Aedyrans simply use it as an excuse for a party and pull out all the stops in an effort to outdo the previous year.

And lest you wonder, as I did, which fercönyng is honored during The Feast of Feasts - it is always the current fercönyng. For each fercönyng is the First and Only fercönyng.

Sweet Treat

A special custom that arose at some point during The Feast of Feasts, Sweet Treat started as a way to keep children occupied so the parents could dine in peace. While it is still used for that today, significance has been added to it. Each treat is placed in a container (usually small metal boxes) and hidden somewhere on the property. After everything has been hidden, the children are sent out to find the "treasures." It is said now that the hidden treats represent Glanfathan artifacts and the children are the explorers, bringing the riches back to their new -and rightful - owners.

Carnival of the Mask

When the original colonists for Aedyr traveled to the new land to found the Dyrwood in the name of the Aedyran fercönyng, they encountered the Glanfathan people. The Carnival of the Mask celebrates this meeting. Originally, it was merely a formal reenactment - as a play - of the tensions between the Glanfathans and Aedyran settlers, but it has since evolved into much more than that. Participants choose "sides" and come dressed in elaborate outfits depicting which group they have decided to align themselves with - Aedyrans or Glanfathans. Everyone attends a masquerade ball and this party replaces any semblance of the play that was presented.

Winter's End

Winter's End was never anything more than an excuse for a celebration and it hasn't changed in all the years it has existed in Aedyr. It takes place during Winter Dusk and lasts all three days. People use the time to reflect on the year, celebrate their lives, and remember the dead - especially those who have passed in the recent year."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Animancy is a science both respected and reviled, sometimes by the same person. For all the research done on the topic, we still know so little. Control over life itself! Something animancers have been working toward for hundreds of years. There are no real records of how the practice of animancy was first discovered, but once the spark of knowledge ignited, there was no stopping its inevitable discoveries.

In 2260 AI, animancers - as a result of their extensive research - successfully contained and transferred a soul. The subject of the experiment, whose name is unknown, was young and wealthy, but infirm. The idea was to move his soul from the dying body and into that of a recently deceased man who had suffered an accident. The new body, bearing only slight decay, would house the soul - giving the man a much better life. The outcome of this experiment resulted in the condemnation and outlaw of animancy in the Aedyran Empire.

Again, while we have no true records of what happened (as they were all destroyed after animancy was outlawed) a journal was discovered, a makeshift confession by one of the participants. Excerpts from that journal follow:

2260 AI, Fonprima, 16
It is done and the gods forgive us for our arrogance. I am not sure what I was expecting - certainly not...that. But what did any of us expect?

Still, behind the revulsion there is a sense of pride - something I can't deny.  All the research. The studying. Everything we worked for. We thought we'd change the world. How it’s changed!

All was in place. The twisted form lying on the table next to its new vessel. The equipment had been prepared. The tinctures and potions all carefully crafted. Every detail painstakingly organized to ensure success. We most assuredly succeeded...

The procedure went exactly as it should. The soul... extracted from the old body... held... bound in place to prevent it from moving on. Then the next step - transfer to the fresh vessel. It was beautiful and terrifying. I listened as they spoke the words of binding. I watched the soul move - not the soul itself, of course, but the vapor we use to detect it - as it lowered into the vessel. A gentle luminescence covered the body and then... nothing.

Silence. Darkness. I held my breath, afraid that even the slightest disturbance would destroy all our hard work.

Then motion. Then...dear gods...then...

Blood.

How did I survive? I do not know. The vessel rose from the slab and the room breathed. Every person crowded around the tables exhaled. Some cheered. We had made life from death. We had become eternal. The body closed its eyes and tilted its head, looking for all purposes to be listening for something - or to it. Then its eyes popped open and it moved. Its lips pealed back from its teeth in a horrible expression of fury. It fell on the nearest man, tearing his throat, knocking him to the ground. Then the room erupted into screams, shouts, and a flurry of bodies running, pushing, doing everything in their power to get away from the creature sitting on their colleague.

But right before that happened, in the split second before the chaos, when there was nothing in the air but a stunned, terrified silence, I heard it. Sitting there on his chest, face at his neck.

And it was feasting."

Thou shalt approach the door, the inevitable shall approach thee.
Do not turn back on the portal, do not turn back on new life.
Walk the path and welcome change or face the knight
For he walks the road with thee and will guide all to their destination.

Thou mortal, the skull thou wilt become.
Thou closed off, the key thou shalt turn.
Thou sealed, the threshold thou shalt cross."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mention the name Pandgram to anyone with even a passing knowledge of animancy and you could find yourself in for a very long discussion. Publicly reviled but privately lauded as a hero and genius, Pandgram's history is at turns revolutionary, horrific, and mysterious. 

Pandgram was fascinated - some might say obsessed - with the concept of animancy. It consumed his life as he dedicated everything to understand it. He would frequently travel to Eir Glanfath and the Dyrwood to visit the Engwithan ruins. There he would take notes and make sketches, bringing anything back with him that he could to help him unlock the mysteries. After years of study, Pandgram had reached the point where he could no longer conduct research on his own, and he took on an assistant - Helig of Thein. Soon, Helig was making trips to Eir Glanfath in Pandgram's stead, gathering knowledge while Pandgram stayed behind to experiment. This partnership quickly bore fruit and Pandgram made a breakthrough - one that would irrevocably change his life and the general attitude about animancy forever.

While the specifics of his experimentation will never truly be known, the rumors and stories that still circulate tell that he had sent out inquiries, asking for live subjects for help with a dangerous experiment that might change their life - or might end it. Those who were already dying were especially encouraged to apply. Response was overwhelming and Pandgram had his pick of numerous willing bodies. That is when he had his breakthrough. He discovered a way to fix a soul, anchoring it to its body so it couldn't leave at death.

He had discovered eternal life.

His research and life's work had resulted in the greatest single discovery that animancy could hope for. His findings were published and quickly spread through Vailia - and beyond. While some groups - the Woedican church, for example - decried his work as nothing more than blasphemy and heresy, many put it to practice. Everyone wanted the chance at immortality.

But everything comes with a cost. It quickly became apparent that simply restraining the soul, while keeping the person technically "alive," was doing nothing for the body, which continued to decay - devolving and warping the soul now trapped inside it. The creatures it created were dangerous - carnivorous beasts that killed brutally and indiscriminately. The backlash was ruthless. The practice of Pandgram's discoveries was outlawed. His works were collected and burned. He and Helig were branded heretics and hunted, chased from town to town until Pandgram simply vanished.

Helig was tracked down, captured, and brought to trial for the atrocities committed against Vailia and its people. The trial was barely more than a formality to bring charges against him as everyone knew what hand he had played in the disaster. He was sent to prison for years, but eventually released once public outrage died down. Not long after his parole, he disappeared as well.

Occasionally, talk surfaces that a copy of Pandgram's theorems has been found, untouched by the purging flames that destroyed its brothers. These rumors seldom end up being more than that. Many groups and wealthy individuals have formed sending out a call to anyone who will listen - find us a copy of the theorems. They offer gold, jewels, status, anything they can to entice adventurers to help them achieve their goals. For there are those who would give anything a chance at immortality - even become a monster."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The origins and practices of Dunryd Row are difficult to nail down. When asked, everyone seems to know how Dunryd Row started and how long it’s been in operation. Yet every person asked gives a different account of its creation and a different date. The only thing everyone can agree on is that it seems to have been around as long as anyone can remember. Without fail, everyone recalls hearing about the exploits of Dunryd Row when they were children.

Aside from the organization being comprised of special investigators (most of whom seem to be ciphers) and the fact that they seem to have their hands in everything (yet never admit to it), anything reported about Dunryd Row walks the line between truth and outright hearsay. Information abounds, but no one can say which fragments are truth and which are fiction. I will provide all I have uncovered and leave it to the readers to decide for themselves, as all of it feels both plausible and unbelievable at turns.

The group is supposedly named after the street where its headquarters are located, in a building called Hadret House. It is said in some circles this is just the name they want people to think they're known by. Their real headquarters, people whisper, is elsewhere. Why would they do this? It's simple - it's far easier for them to infiltrate, to hide, to carry on behind the scenes if everyone is concentrating on ‘Dunryd Row.’ Divert attention where you want people to look and you can act behind their backs with impunity. 

People who have had interactions with agents from Dunryd Row invariably describe them as ‘unmemorable.’ No detail as to their appearance, behavior, or anything - beyond the fact that they were there - seems to stick with anyone. Are they truly nondescript? Or do their ciphers use their powers to remain anonymous? As with so many questions regarding Dunryd Row, no one seems to know. While no specific details about the agents are ever reported, one "fact" that all people agree with is that they seem primarily to be orlans and Glanfathan elves, though theories as to why this may be are many and conflicting.

Their presumed headquarters is supposedly run by Lady Eydis Webb. Though no one seems able to pinpoint the time of her arrival, the author was unable to locate a single person familiar with Dunryd Row who could remember a time when she wasn't around. Many things are hinted at behind closed doors about Lady Webb, but few are willing to elaborate, for it is rumored that although she has not left Hadret House since anyone can remember, she is a cipher of tremendous power, and that she can read the thoughts of the entire city at will. Theories abound regarding her age, her reasons for what would seem to be a lifetime of seclusion, and even of her secret control over all of Defiance Bay, if not Dyrwood itself. But as with all other matters regarding the organization, no one seems to be able to say anything for sure. "

      <DefaultText>Characters, in order of appearance
Belmis, the Doughty Burglar
Torfal, the man of the house
Clanna, the lady of the house
Pafenda, the maid
Ireby, an important visitor

Setting: Interior. The sitting room of Torfal's house. Night.
The stage is dark. The door to the room opens and Belmis enters, holding a candle. He walks slowly through the room, picking up items, examining them, and replacing them. Presently, there is a noise off-stage. Belmis freezes and listens.

TORFAL (offstage): Enough of this nonsense! I told you we would be returning early!
CLANNA (offstage): You said early! You didn't say we would be inexcusably rude!

The voices are approaching the door to the sitting room. Belmis extinguishes that candle and hides behind chair at the end of the stage opposite the door. The door opens.

TORFAL (entering, followed by Clanna and Pafenda, voice even and controlled): This meeting is very important, Clanna, my little cowslip. Ireby is taking this meeting himself. This is unheard of!
CLANNA: But, Torfal-
TORFAL: Not another word!

Belmis's head appears over the chair during this exchange. He watches the three interact. When Clanna talks, he is entranced by her.

TORFAL: Pafenda, have all the preparations been made for Ireby's arrival?
PAFENDA: Yes, sir. The special brandy has been brought from the cellar. And the... other refreshment has been prepared as well.
CLANNA: Other... Torfal! Don't you dare!
TORFAL: If that's what it takes, Clanna, that's what I'll do. Now, go prepare yourself for Ireby's arrival. We must all look our best. This contract must not fail!

All three leave the room. Belmis stands.

BELMIS: Who was that vision? Who was that goddess? Who was it that has stolen my heart just as surely as I would steal hers? I must know her. I must meet her. I must have her! But how?</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Edrang Hadret in retrospect led a remarkable life. But his contributions would probably have gone largely unnoticed if it weren't for his conflict with a Glanfathan orlan by the name of Galven Regd.

Though Edrang became a great man and a well-respected leader, his early life was uneventful. He was born in Aedyr of noble parents and spent a good part of his childhood there. While he was raised apart from the common folk, he felt a connection to them and was known to always be welcoming to any and all.

In school, he demonstrated incredible intelligence, frequently arriving at correct conclusions using his own methods of getting there. He was always doing unexpected things and though he seemed to be paying attention and would pass his lessons, his teachers and trainers were certain he would never amount to anything.

His family moved to the Dyrwood as colonists while he was still a teen. The moment they docked in the new land, Edrang knew he had found his true home. He explored the land, getting to know it and its people as well as he knew the castle in which he lived. He grew into a man who was well-respected by all who met him. He took over the erldom, becoming a fair and much beloved leader. Under his leadership, Baelreach thrived, becoming more stable and prosperous than anyone thought possible. When a new gréf was needed, the people's voice was unanimous - Edrang Hadret.

As his first act as the new gréf, the fercönyng instructs Edrang to build a new city for him, a seat of power in the Pearlwood Gulf. This city is to be called New Dunryd and will serve as the capital for the new colonies. Not long after he assumed power, The Broken Stone War began. It was a quick and brutal war and taxed the limits of Edrang's capabilities. He had never before encountered someone as organized and brutal as the opposition commander, Galven Regd. At first Regd's tactics confounded Edrang. But Edrang, who grew up developing unorthodox ways to take care of his problems, adapted quickly.

This did not stop Galven Regd outright, however. He began a campaign of terror that lasted for two more years. Edrang, who expressed a sort of respect for Regd's prowess, studied his techniques, learning how Regd attacked and devising a ways to counter it. He gave the erls and thayns instructions that confounded and sometimes infuriated them as they seemed to leave their lands open for attack and put their people at risk. Edrang disseminated lies and half-truths about his plans, imperial events, and military maneuvers. No one knew what truly was going on except for Edrang and a very small contingent of trusted friends and advisors. His tactics worked and Edrang's men started to catch the Glanfathans off guard.

It wasn't long before Edrang's men were able to anticipate Regd's moves and cut him off at every front. When asked how he was able to overcome an enemy that anticipated every move, Edrang responded, ‘That is how he was about to outwit us. Our moves were transparent. Anyone could see through the standard tactic. Spread something out thin enough and you can poke a hole in it. I countered an unpredictable enemy with unpredictability.’

Because Edrang was able to counter Regd's plans, the conflict eventually died off. Regd sent a message to Edrang, expressing respect for his tactics and prowess with military maneuvers. This political and military stalemate led to the first treaties signed between the Glanfathans and the Aedyran colonist who would eventually become the Dyrwoodans."

      <DefaultText>"The history of Eir Glanfath before it was discovered by Aedyran explorers is poorly documented and oral accounts often conflict. Some tell stories of an advanced civilization that left, taking all its knowledge with it, leaving ruins of their civilization behind. Others say the Glanfathans themselves developed such power and technology that they all but destroyed themselves and that is why they will not allow anyone into the ruins on their land. Either way, reliable information about the area of Eir Glanfath doesn't begin until Aedyran explorers discovered it in 2602 AI.
 
The Glanfathans were not used to encounters with outsiders before and viewed the intrusion on their land as something of a test. The ruins that covered their land were considered sacred and these strangers, despite warnings, plundered them, taking artifacts. Glanfathans that resisted were captured and forced into slavery, becoming property of the new colonists. Their people, heritage, and land at stake, the Glanfathans struck back, hoping to drive them out of their lands permanently. Despite their best efforts, more Aedyran invaders appeared. By 2623 AI, the Aedyrans had established towns, pushing the Glanfathans out of some areas and enslaving any who refused to leave. They tried to live in peace, keeping an eye on the Aedyrans, and with the exception of a few isolated incidents, it seemed to work. This tentative peace came to a bloody end in 2626 AI. A group of farmers, clearing a potential crop field in the middle of an area dotted with many sacred ruins, knocked down one of the ancient menhirs. Whether this was intentional or accidental is not known, but this incident started what came to be known as the Broken Stone War. It was short, lasting less than a year, but it was bloody and brutal. Several thousand Aedyran colonists died as well as hundreds of Glanfathans.

Though the war ended, the attacks on the Aedyrans didn't stop. An orlan named Regd was chosen as galven of the Glanfathans. He vowed to make every outsider pay for the injustices done on his people's land. He organized the Glanfathan Fangs and orchestrated a series of attacks over the course of the next two years. It seemed Regd's tactics would eventually work and drive the Aedyrans from Eir Glanfath, but then they started fighting back. They became far more organized and their tactics less predictable. Fewer and fewer of Regd's attacks succeeded. He discovered a new gréf, Edrang Hadret, had been appointed - someone whose tactics and battle savvy were more evenly matched with his. Eventually both leaders came to a stalemate, neither able to gain the upper hand on the other.

As a result of the stalemate, the hostilities between the two groups dwindled as there was never a significant result for either side. This led to treaties, developed and signed by both, to eliminate the violence and tension. Regd stepped down as galven and returned to his life. Hadret set a decree - looting the ruins of Eir Glanfath is an arrestable offense. As a sign of goodwill, Hadret also tried to outlaw slavery, but this act was struck down by the other erls and the fercönyng of Aedyr. Because of this, some incidents of rural violence still cropped up. Hadret's treaties resulted in 20 years of relative peace for the Glanfathans, still wary and distrustful of the Aedyrans, but willing to accept their presence if they had to."

      <DefaultText>“The Ethik Nol is a group both fascinating and dangerous. An ancient druidic order, its beliefs fall well outside what the average person might imagine of druids. 

Though details are sketchy, the Ethik Nol would seem to have originated in the White March, as the order itself consists mostly of dwarves. The traditional druidic chants of the Ethik Nol speak of the people as a ‘collective whole’ that ‘created a necessary balance’ through their ‘strict adherence to the purity’ of their line. This has been interpreted by historical chroniclers to mean that there was a time when only dwarves were allowed to be Ethik Nol.

Residing now in Twin Elms, records of the Ethik Nol date back to well before the settlement had arrived at its present name, and in fact, some information places them in Twin Elms even before the Glanfathans arrived. If this is truly the case, the Ethik Nol are one of the oldest druidic orders in existence.

Their beliefs don't conform to what is normally viewed as a ‘druidic viewpoint.’ Sacrifice, blood, fire, and an intense drive for balance in all things (well beyond most druidic standards) pervade their rituals. Core to this is the dogma that if you want something from the universe, you must also sacrifice something into the universe to maintain the balance. Nothing can ever be received without something first being given. If you perform the sacrifice, your desires will always be satiated. The simplest example of the sacrificial balance as explained to the author went as thus:

‘Say you are one of these Ethik Nol. And say you want your daughter's marriage to go well. You don't want problems. So you ask of the elders what you must do. You are told what the appropriate sacrifice is, and then you perform it. In this case, it could be as simple as throwing some coins into lava, giving the metal back to the earth. Sacrificing something that is important to you, right? But the requirement is always different and you don't know what is expected of you until you're asked. The more significant request, the more significant the demand. And most things of true value must be paid in blood.’

I was told of people removing fingers, toes, even whole limbs. One farmer was reputed to have sacrificed his youngest son.

Another good question many people have raised is in regards to the Glanfathans. Why do they allow such a potentially violent, possibly dangerous group to live in Eir Glanfath? Why not force them out? Rumors are that the Ethik Nol are able to make from an ancient recipe a unique war paint, apparently blood-based, and they are the only people in the world who can. The Glanfathans, it is said, have come to believe this war paint provides tremendous advantage in combat, and the residence of the Ethik Nol in Twin Elms is predicated on the fair trade of the substance.”</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mention the name Regd in Eir Glanfath and you'll be told stories of a glorious freedom fighter - an orlan who used his tactical savvy and battle training to protect the Glanfathan from the encroaching evil of the invaders in the Dyrwood. Ask someone in the Dyrwood about him and you'll hear angry retellings of the exploits of an underhanded, dirty-fighting orlan who terrorized Dyrwoodan citizens. This conflict is what legends are built on and Galven Regd is the stuff of legends.

The Broken Stone War began from a misunderstanding between the Glanfathans who lived in the Dyrwood and the Aedyran colonists who were moving in. Tensions were already high between the two groups as the Aedyrans claimed land the Glanfathans said they already owned. Add to it the Glanfathans taken and forced into slavery by the Aedyrans and it was only a matter of time before something snapped and sent the two groups to war. There was the occasional skirmish or fight between isolated groups, but no real conflict until The Broken Stone War.

Whether intentional or not, Aedyran farmers, clearing land for their crops, knocked over and destroyed one of the ancient menhirs that dot the countryside. The Glanfathans, who revered the ancient structures in the Dyrwood, reacted swiftly and violently led by a particularly fanatical Fang by the name of Regd. While the war was short-lived and the Glanfathans were ultimately not the victors, Regd and his forces were able to eliminate a significant number of colonists.

After the war ended, Regd was appointed the Galven, or leader, of the Glanfathan tribes. His leadership skills and prowess in battle earned him the respect of all the tribes of Eir Glanfath. Because all the tribes were unified behind him, he was able to move and coordinate their warriors in a way that organized them into such an efficient team, the Aedyran colonists lived in fear of his next attack. His name and reputation spread through both lands. Over two years following The Broken Stone War, Regd and his forces, using deception, misinformation, and straightforward guerrilla tactics killed hundreds. The remaining erls send word to the fercönyng, saying something must be done before more nobility is killed, but Regd continues to terrorize the colonists and it seems the campaign will never end.

That is, until he encountered Edrang Hadret."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Glanfathan customs can seem primitive and unsophisticated to some. But all customs begin with a ritual or superstition, so why should theirs be considered less than any other? If they are examined closely, Glanfathan celebrations stem from a deep and rich culture and all tie in to their history in a significant way.

The Festival of the Ancients

The Festival of the Ancients takes place during Spring Dawn and is a time to celebrate the Glanfathans settling in Eir Glanfath. It is a simple, three-day ceremony that is mostly centered on feasts. These feasts are set up around the ruins scattered through Eir Glanfath. Wreaths made from tree branches and flowers are placed at the ruins and prayers are said to the gods, thanking them for health and prosperity.

The Cleansing

The Cleansing started as a protest, recreating the hardships wrought upon the Glanfathans by the Aedyran colonists when they started settling the Dyrwood. It has morphed over the years and is now used more as a game mixed with a teaching tool to inform your Glanfathans about the history of their people. The Cleansing takes place on New Year and Mid Year and now acts as a metaphor for real events instead of a recreation of the events themselves. Xaurip effigies are placed throughout the forest, hollow clay shells filled with sweets and gifts. The children then search the woods for the effigies and destroy them, "cleansing" the forest so they Glanfathans can move in and occupy the areas. After the area has been cleared, they gather for a celebration and feast where the elders tell the young members the true story of their people's history.

Holiday of the Black Tree

A combination of a day of remembrance and celebratory feast, the Holiday of the Black Tree is held on the second day of Autumn Falling when the trees are still colorful but losing their leaves and the land is becoming cold and dark. Glanfathans use the day to tell the story of the War of the Black Trees and remember those who were lost. During the morning, the adults hang elaborate garlands from the tree branches. The garlands are made from red, orange, and yellow flowers and represent the flames that swept through the forests of Eir Glanfath, destroying everything in their paths. After a morning of fasting and reflection, the children are set to run through the trees, tearing down the garlands and bring them back to the feast, decorating the tables with wildflowers, turning the horror of war into something beautiful. Then they eat, cheering the peace they now have with the Dyrwoodan people and toast to many more years of peace to come.

Also of note in Glanfathan culture is their abundance of traveling customs. Being a semi-nomadic people, they practice customs to ensure their safety while on the move.

Traveling Customs

If you are taking a quick trip, purchase a gift for someone you are visiting and leave it at your home. If something important is left undone (such as giving a gift to a loved one), you will always return to finish the task.

If you are taking a longer trip, leave remembrances of your trip - no matter how well you know the road. Drop some pebbles along the way or tie ribbon to the tree branches. Mark your path away and you'll always have a safe and easy trip back.

Evil spirits and dangerous creatures are everywhere in our world. If you decorate your cart with masks, they will scare away any danger that might otherwise approach. But you must decorate your cart anew every trim or the evil won't be fooled by your ruse!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What can be said about House Doemenel that isn't whispered fearfully in a back room over the dim light of a dying fire in fear that the wrong set of ears will hear it? The Doemenel history is colorful and violent, exciting and more than a little bloody.

The Doemenels were a small Aedyran family that dealt almost exclusively in textiles. They made a modest living, slowly gaining a reputation for having high-quality product. This reputation earned them connections – business, social, and sometimes marital – that solidified their position as the premiere family of the region. If you wanted access to anyone, the Doemenels were the way to do it.

Soon, every city had a business that was owned, at least in part, by the Doemenels. Their power and influence grew until many said the family had more power than even the fercönyng of Aedyr.

But with the power came the corruption. One cannot have that level of control and expect to keep it through strictly legal means. Soon, rumors were spreading of threats, and extortion. Though it cannot be proven, the unofficial report is that the Doemenels were responsible for the death of Trindig Byrnwigr which left his entire shipping empire in the hands of his wife, Udele Doemenel Byrnwigr.

With their hold on the land practically secured, the Doemenels no longer stuck to the shadows, brazenly eliminating opponents, manipulating deals, and threatening anyone who might cause them a problem. Because they now dominated the trade route, no one dared oppose them anymore for fear their business would be strangled.

Like most empires, though, not even theirs could last forever. The end came during the War of Defiance. Unlike most of the land, the Doemenels threw in with Aedyr instead of Admeth Hadret. After the defeat of the empire and the destruction wrought on the land during the war, not even the Doemenels could rebuild what they had. And, having history show them on the wrong side of the war, no one would touch the name. The domain that took years to build crumbled in mere months.

Today, the Doemenels have once again built a name for themselves, proving they are still capable and savvy businesspeople. Rumors about the family still circulate, though. Word is members of the family are striving to lift the family from its current obscurity and elevate it to the level of power it once held."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In recent years, the Knights of the Crucible has evolved as a group. No longer concentrating solely on blacksmithing or combat training, they've adjusted their focus to help initiates develop their souls as well as their bodies. From initiation there is a well-defined path to the top of the order.

Squire

When a candidate shows sufficient prowess in blacksmithing (or, recently, at least the drive and potential), he is accepted into the order as a Squire. Once he is part of the order, training begins immediately. Lessons are divided into two main sections - Body, commanded by the Lord Marshal and Soul, overseen by the Grand Crucilar. At this point in their progression the only uniform the squire is allowed is a simple cloth uniform displaying the Knights’ colors.

Novitiate

After sufficient training, each Squire is given a three-part test. He must repair a broken piece of armor, he must recite the Canticles of Abydon from memory, and he must be able to land a blow on a Novitiate in combat. If he succeeds at all three of these tasks, he is promoted to the position of Novitiate. At this point he is given his first official piece of Crucible armor - a brigandine. His training now doubles, as only the most valiant of candidates makes it through to the next level.

Justiciar and Templus

When a Novitiate shows he is ready (decided by his teachers and trainers), he must make a decision. His training and advancement from this point on will focus on one of the two disciplines: Body or Soul. Novitiates that choose Body continue military training as a Justiciar under the Lord Marshal. Novitiates that choose Soul are given clerical training as a Templus under the Grand Crucilar. Justiciar or Templus, the newly appointed is taken through the Ritual of the Arm. He is given his plate armor and symbol of Abydon. He is then taken to the Smith's Forge (named after Abydon) and is tasked with forging a small nail out of iron. He affixes this nail to his armor under Abydon's symbol and will wear it there for the rest of his life as a Knight of the Crucible. At this point, the Knight's training is fixed. If he chose Body, that is the path he is on until the end of his days. If he chose Soul, there is no deviating from the course. That is why the choice is only presented after he has been through many months of training."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The Archipelago winds its way between The Great Eastern Ocean and The Restless Ocean - hundreds of small islands in the midst of the water. Few dare brave its treacherous rapids, and fewer still have returned to tell tale of their adventures through it.
 
Travel between the two oceans is virtually impossible. Great storms hammer any ships foolhardy enough to attempt to navigate, and this alone should be enough to deter anyone from attempting the voyage as untold ships have gone down, tossed against the rocks.

The weather and treacherous rocks are only a precursor to the actual horror of the archipelago, the terrors of the deep. No one knows how many creatures stalk the oceans, waiting for unsuspecting sailors to drift into their waters. But we do know of some.


Barbed Ravager

A giant shark that is known to ram passing vessels, trying to knock sailors off the deck and smash a hole in the hull. It has tremendous spines protruding from its side and back that are presumed to be poisonous. The largest sighted Barbed Ravager (with survivors) was estimated to be almost 30 feet long.


Winding Serpent

Smaller around than the Ravager, but potentially longer, the Winding Serpent attacks in small packs, usually 3-8. They have long, sharp heads, somewhat reminiscent of a barracuda. 

Like the Ravager, they repeatedly slam into the side of a ship hoping to crack a hole in it or knock someone from the deck. They have also been known to swim to the depths and shoot up out of the ocean, landing on the deck, coiling and winding their way around, snapping up any crew they can before plunging back into the ocean.


Leviathan

Imagine the largest whale you have ever seen. The leviathan is at least ten times that size. By the time a ship sees a leviathan, it is already too late. As they rise from the depths, the water around them begins to spin and sink, creating a whirlpool. 

The leviathan's body surrounds the hapless vessel, preventing escape, and as it goes down, the enormous mouth opens, pulling all aboard to their watery deaths.


Polpovir

All the creatures you've read about in this book are nothing compared to the Polpovir. Barely the size of a man, what they lack in size and strength, they make up for in numbers and terrifying viciousness. 

Their lower halves are a mass of tentacles like an octopus or squid, but more numerous. The tentacles are long, black whips with suction cups on the underside and small thorny barbs on the top. The sheer number of tentacles gives them frightening speed when walking on land, pulling themselves forward almost as fast as a running horse. 

While they vaguely resemble a human from the waist up, any extended examination proves how wrong that assumption is. Long, stringy black hair falls from the top of their heads to cover a face taken directly from a nightmare. A wide, gaping mouth, cuts across the bottom of its head from ear to ear, full of wicked dagger-like teeth. Two large round eyes are sunken into its head, black as coal, shining with a malevolent fire. A small antenna protrudes from the middle of its forehead, ending in a small nodule that can glow with an eerie blue light.

One can imagine a sailor on the deck of his ship at night, looking out across the black water, blood freezing as countless lights appear beneath the surface, rising toward him as the Polpovir swarm upward. 

Because they seem to be more octopus than man, they can collapse in on themselves, fitting into spaces no person should be able to. The smallest crack in a hull, the slightest separation between boards offers them entrance. It is not unknown for them to slaughter an entire crew from hold up to deck by infiltrating the ship from underneath. 

Fortunately they do not seem to have spread too far outside of the archipelago, but there may come a day when Polpovir attacks become commonplace."

I move.
There is no compulsion. It is not a need.
But something pulls.
I cannot deny its draw.

The white wends out past my vision.
Its fierce eyes watch me as I move.
The wolf tracks my step.
A silent companion who will not join.

All is blank. The pale expanse lies before and behind.

I search.
The miles pass and still my feet move.
My hunt continues unabated.
The landscape returns my gaze, unaffected by my presence.

The snow falls, needles driven by the wind.
Its cold teeth bite my skin.
The snow gathers, its hands around my feet,
A fierce opponent who will not relent.

All is white. My journey continues.

I travel.
I can no longer stop. A true compulsion forms.
The need drives me on.
I must see.

The sun breaks through the gray.
Its unrelenting gaze thaws me.
My body warms under its touch,
Frigid limbs move again and carry me farther.

All is empty. The breadth of existence is my destination."</DefaultText>

Man
Male, a Ghostly Being
Female, a Ghostly Being
Beggar
Starving Man
Injured Man

Setting: Empty field. No trees or buildings in sight.

A man lies on the ground center stage. He wakes slowly and looks around. Two Ghostly Beings approach him, a male from the stage left, a female from stage right.

MAN: Where am I? What has happened?
MALE: Nothing has happened.
MAN: How did I get here?
FEMALE: You did not arrive. You are just here.
MAN: What is going on?
MALE &amp; FEMALE: You are traveling. We will travel with you.

They both reach out a hand to him, insistently. He looks at them, not sure what to do. After a few moments of deliberation, he takes Male's hand and allows him to help.

MALE (aside, to Female): His soul is strong. This decision will be easy.
FEMALE (aside, to Male): Such arrogance surely will be your undoing.

They walk to the end of the stage and encounter a Beggar, holding out a bowl.

BEGGAR: Will you help the needy? Will you hear the call of charity? What will you do for those less fortunate?
MALE: Here is a beggar. What will you do? He has no food, no clothes. He is destitute and will surely die if no mercy is shown him.
FEMALE: Surely he deserves no mercy. Look to his legs - do they not move? Look to his arms - can they not work? Look to his eyes - can they not see? Surely he can provide for himself?

MALE &amp; FEMALE: What will you do?

The man ponders for a moment, then reaches into his pocket and drops a coin in the Beggar's bowl.

BEGGAR: Thank you, kind sir. May your charity come back to you in turn!

MALE &amp; FEMALE: Why did you give alms to this beggar?

MAN: I saw a man in need. It is not for me to say if he deserves mercy, only that I need provide mercy if I am able. I have the means to help, so I help. If he has the ability to provide for himself and does not, that is on his head, not mine. If I can provide the light of dawn to a man in need, it is my duty to do so.

MALE (aside, to Female): He knows Charity, even disguised as a beggar. His mind is open.
FEMALE (aside, to Male): Even those with an open mind can be closed down.

MALE &amp; FEMALE: Let us continue our journey.

They walk to the other edge of the stage, leaving the Beggar behind. They approach the Starving Man, who puts out his hands in supplication

STARVING MAN: A crust? A morsel? Please? Surely generosity will not allow you to stand by and let someone starve!
MALE: This man is starving. What will you do? He is on the brink of death. Only an act of generosity will save him.
FEMALE: What need has this man that he cannot provide for himself? Why should you turn over that which you earned to one who has done no such act and who deserves nothing from you?

MALE &amp; FEMALE: What will you do?

Again, the man considers what he will do. He reaches into his pocket and retrieves a piece of bread and gives it to the Starving Man.

STARVING MAN: Thank you! Thank you, good sir! May your generosity be returned unto you tenfold!

MALE &amp; FEMALE: Why did you give food to the hungry?

MAN: I saw a man who hungered. It is not for me to say if he deserves a morsel, only that I need provide a morsel if I am able. I have the food to spare, so I give. If I can open a man's eyes to the light, it is my duty to do so.

MALE (aside, to Female): He knows Generosity, even disguised as a starving man. His heart is giving.
FEMALE (aside, to Male): Even those with a giving heart can be greedy.

MALE &amp; FEMALE: We will continue our journey."

      <DefaultText>"With the mention of the name Waidwen, most folk think only one word - Godhammer. While this event echoes through the ages and is still felt years after the destruction of Evon Dewr Bridge, Waidwen's humble beginnings belie the powerful force he would grow into.

Waidwen lived an unassuming life in a remote area of Readceras, the son of vorlas farmers. He toiled in the fields alongside his father for 22 years, until his father's death. The farm then fell to him to run. He considered selling, but had no other skills upon which to draw, so he set on the path of vorlas farmer as well. Nothing of note has been recorded in Waidwen's life until 4 years after his father's death. One day, while working the fields, Waidwen's life was irrevocably changed. In his words:

‘Night was falling, the fingers of dusk already gripping the sky. The sun had dipped behind the world's edge and stars were peeking from beyond the Shroud. The day was still and darkness had blanketed the field. I placed my last harvest of the day into the collection pile when from behind me arose a brilliant light. I turned, fear in my breast, knowing not what could have caused such intense radiance.

Behind me stood a blazing figure, resplendent in glory. Its white flesh glowed with a luminescent radiance, its head a blinding ball of light, brighter than the highest sun of Mid Year. I averted my gaze, afraid I would be struck down for daring to gaze upon such a creature.

A sudden peace washed over me, sweeping away my fear, leaving my troubled soul tranquil. A loving warmth wrapped its arms around me. A voice spoke to me as I stood, transfixed, trying to both see this glorious being and avoid its dazzling scrutiny.

"Fear not," it said to me, "for you are chosen above all others. You will be the light to bring about the rebirth of an empire." It then held out its hand and bestowed upon me a vision of power, such that I could scarcely contain it.’

Waidwen, disheveled and dirty, stumbled into his village the next morning, telling all who would listen about the miracle that happened in his fields. Eothas himself, he claimed, had appeared to him. He was to punish the Aedyran governor for leading his people into ruin. A way would be provided and those faithful who helped would be blessed when ‘the divinity manifested.’ Villagers ignored him, convinced the loss of his parents had broken his mind.

But Waidwen continued to preach of the power of Eothas and the corruption of the governor, eventually earning him the ire of the locals. His confrontations with the villagers hit a turning point one day in Mid Autumn. A crowd had gathered around Waidwen, jeering him and telling him to leave the village. The vorlas crop that season was particularly light and the villagers blamed Waidwen, saying he had angered the gods, particularly Eothas, with his blasphemy. They backed him into one of the withered fields, yelling at him to go. Accounts of the inciting action are hazy. Some say a stone was thrown, others say he was pushed, other still say he simply tripped over a dry root sticking from the ground. Regardless of the cause, Waidwen landed, face down, on the ground, the villagers standing over him, laughing.

‘Enough!’ a voice, not Waidwen's, boomed across the field. Waidwen looked up at the crowd, his eyes glowing with a blinding white light. He stood, but did not stand. One moment he was on the ground and the next he was standing before the crowd, who cowered before him.

‘You dare deny me?’ the voice spoke through Waidwen's mouth. ‘You dare refuse my servant?’ Waidwen's arms raised, beginning to luminesce. 'You dare require proof?' His arms went out to his sides. ‘Never ask again, lest you be burned in the light of the new dawn!’ There was a flash of light from Waidwen's eyes and hands and the entire field sprang to life. The once dried and brittle plants became full, lush, and verdant.

The crowd was silent. From somewhere in the back came a call of ‘Praise Eothas!’ and then they all fell to their knees in front of Waidwen, farmer-turned-god."

      <DefaultText>"In approximately 2200 AI, a group of tribes called The People of the Deer unified into a new civilization called the Aedyr Kingdom. The tribes, small and widespread over the land, knew it would be better for their continued existence to unify. The leaders of each tribe became advisors to the king, chosen by the group. Each advisor would still be lord over his people, but each lord would answer to the fercönyng (FAYR-cö-ning, "first king"). This decision turned out to be exactly what was needed and the Aedyran Kingdom thrived, spreading out over the land, establishing strong trade routes, and became known to be fair - but shrewd - businessmen. While the country thrived and internally there was little strife, there were still the occasional skirmishes with the neighboring elven kingdom of Kulklin.

Not long after the kingdom was formed, the Aedyran people began studying animancy. Still largely unknown at that time, it was an exciting, terrifying new realm that Aedyran scholars saw great potential in. This potential came to bear fruit in 2260 AI, when a group of animancers - working together - transferred the soul of a recently departed man into another body, creating the first of what would later come to be known as the "undead." The reaction to this discovery was swift and decisive. Both the king of Aedyr and the church of Woedica condemned this event and the study or practice of animancy was outlawed. It would never again be practiced openly on Aedyran soil.

Conflicts with Kulklin continued, escalating into a minor war in 2398 AI. Afterward, a treaty was signed and the Kingdom of Aedyr merged with Kulklin to form the Aedyr Empire. With the political and military strife now settled, the Aedyr Empire would become an economic powerhouse. Able to provide resources that were hard to find in other parts of the world, their trade routes became some of the most lucrative in the world."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"‘If the blacksmith fails, the armor fails. If the armor fails, the soldier falls.’ - Olrun Cyneheod, first guild master of the Knights of the Crucible.

The Knights of the Crucible have one of the most fascinating and rich histories in all of Eora. Currently holding a position as an incredibly influential group in the Dyrwood, they come from humble beginnings. There may not be a single person in all the Dyrwood who knows exactly how much they owe to the Knights.

The group has existed for years - long before they even came to be known as "knights." They started as a group of blacksmiths, led by Olrun Cyneheod, who came together to form a guild. Olrun felt it imperative for the members to unify, sharing their knowledge through the guild in order to keep the skills and techniques they had spent their lives perfecting. He called the guild "The Crucible," insisting that, though their work was used for destruction, they should always be remembered as creators. They would be known as the vessel that withstands the fire to deliver new form into the world, forged in the fire and all the stronger for the tribulation. Olrun, being a veteran of many battles, knew the importance of impeccably made armor and weaponry. He also espoused the necessity for members of the guild to be trained in martial combat - "The only true way to make a proper suit of armor is to be the one who must wear it."

Olrun led the guild for years, instituting a policy that any man who wanted to join must not only be a skilled blacksmith, but also take the time to learn how to hold himself in battle. He added a training ground to their guild hall and there was scarcely a minute of daylight that didn't see members out on the field, honing their fighting technique. Because of this, the guild earned the nickname ‘Knights of the Crucible.’ They became a de facto militia for the Dyrwood, an honorable group that many turned to for help. They were known to be fair, ethical, and quick to respond.

The Knights chose Abydon as their patron, dedicating their works to his name. To honor him, they incorporated his symbol into their own and wore it on their arms. Many of the Knights took this honor further - regardless of what material a suit of armor was made from, something on the right arm was made with iron, celebrating Abydon's moniker, ‘The Iron Arm.’ Both of these traditions are followed by some of the Knights to this day.

The Knights’ smithing skill led them to be known throughout the land as the premiere artisans of their craft, leading people to call any item of exquisite quality "of the Crucible."

Their training and dedication truly came into play during the War of Defiance (locally known as Hadret's Rebellion). Olrun, knowing the importance winning this war, sent out a call - all able-bodied Knights were to join the militia. They quickly proved invaluable to the cause and helped turned the tide of the rebellion. This was particularly true in the Battle of Defiance Bay. Admeth had already been lost in a previous battle and morale for the Dyrwoodan militia was failing. With the help of Glanfathan astrologers, the Knights were able to rout the imperial forces and secure victory for Dyrwood.

The new duc, grateful for the help, and knowing that without the Knights, the Dyrwood never would have survived, made a decree. The Knights would thenceforth be welcomed into the duc's castle and become his official royal guard.

In recent years, the ‘crucible’ aspect has fallen by the wayside in favor of ‘knight.’ The requirement that the members be proficient in both smithing and martial combat has loosened to the point that anyone who applies is guaranteed entrance, even if they possess little or no smithing experience. This is an allegation that is vehemently denied by the Knights. "</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Anni Iroccio: The New Year

While only 150 years old (and of Vailian origin as well), the Iroccian calendar is currently used throughout most of the Dyrwood and the surrounding areas. While the Dyrwood was using the Aedyran calendar until recently, they gave it up in favor of the Iroccian calendar. The transition was easy to get people to make because the Aedyran calendar was hopelessly inaccurate.

Iroccio calculated that it takes the planet approximately 334 days to orbit the sun, so he took the nine months from the Aedyran calendar and broke them into sixteen months of twenty days each, with each season consisting of four months. The length of each month corresponds to how long it takes Belafa (one of our moons) to circle the planet. At the end of each season, three days - not part of either season - are set aside for people to celebrate the transitions. Lastly, the final two days of the year - New Year and Mid Year - are used to observe the beginning and midpoint of the year.

To prevent any confusion for the transition from the old calendar to the new, Iroccio kept the year the same. So, although the calendar has only been in existence for 150 years, it is currently 2823 AI (Anni Iroccio).

Iroccio gave the months Vailian names, but in the Dyrwood and surrounding areas, they call them by their translated names.

The year is broken down in the following way -

New Year - A day to celebrate the arrival of the new year. Of all the holidays, this one is celebrated by most people around the Dyrwood and the Vailian Republics. Each new year is greeted with a fervent zeal to begin things anew and start with a fresh slate.

Winter Months (Two at the beginning of the year and two at the end)

Deep Winter - Fonivèrno 
Late Winter - Tarivèrno 

Spring Dawn (3 days) - Inprima - Used to celebrate the transition of the world, rebirth, and Spring. Eothasian festivals are especially prevalent at this time, or were, prior to the Saint’s War. 
 
Spring Months

Early Spring - Préprima
Mid Spring - Majprima
Deep Spring - Fonprima
Late Spring - Tarprima

Summer Rising (3 days) - Inestu - A period of transition from birth to growth. Many ceremonies designed to usher children into adulthood take place during Summer Rising.

Summer Months (and Mid Year)

Early Summer - Préëstu
Mid Summer - Majestu

Mid Year - A day of reflection and introspection. The year is half over. People who made promises on New Year use Mid Year to assess their progress and renew their oaths.

Deep Summer - Fonestu
Late Summer - Tarestu

Autumn Falling (3 days) - Inauton - Harvest celebrations happen during Autumn Falling if the crops were particularly bountiful. If the harvest was small, supplication is given to the gods asking for a better harvest the following year.

Autumn Months

Early Autumn - Préauton
Mid Autumn - Majauton
Deep Autumn - Fonauton
Late Autumn - Tarauton

Winter Dusk (3 days) - Inivèrno (ihn-ih-VEHR-no) - Winter Dusk is filled with celebrations of life and vigils for the dead. The world is returning to sleep, plants die, and those still alive raise a toast to another year.

Winter Months

Early Winter - Préïvèrno (pree-ih-VEHR-no)

      <DefaultText>"Scarcely a decade ago, on the Evon Dewr Bridge, seven men and five women fought valiantly to protect their homeland. They volunteered for the mission knowing it was up to them, and them alone, to prevent St. Waidwen from crossing the bridge. They succeeded, even though they lost all but four of their number in the battle, and Waidwen was on the bridge when the Godhammer detonated. The final four were lost in the blast as well, their sacrifice a testament to their dedication.

The Dozens, a group ostensibly formed for the protection of the Dyrwood, was founded in the honor of those men and women. Indeed, those twelve men and women are posthumously regarded by the Dozens as their true ‘founders.’ Initially, the group dedicated itself to protecting Dyrwood from invasion, patrolling the borders tirelessly in search of Readceran forces regrouping for another attack. When that attack never materialized, many of the Dozens thought the next threat might come from Eothasian loyalists living in Dyrwood and began to turn their attention within.

All new members of the Dozens are required to swear an oath to remember the sacrifice of their founders and remain vigilant against Readceras and any followers of Eothas. To this end, worshipers of Eothas are routinely harassed by the Dozens.

The mindset of this group may be hard for some to understand as any fanatical devotion can sometimes overshadow the ideals. But the original "Dozen" knowingly sacrificed their lives for Dyrwood. From the Dozens’ perspective, how can new members of the Dozens be any less committed to their country’s welfare? What better way could there be to honor their founders?

The Dozens are not a large group, but what they lack in size, they make up in fervent devotion to their cause and a gift for gaining the ear of commoners. This makes them a force to be reckoned with, and there is no more influential group in shaping the discourse surrounding Waidwen’s Legacy. A small but very vocal minority of extremists in the group are calling for a new war with Readceras. Talk of purging the Dyrwood of all followers of Eothas is also being touted. More recently they have begun to see in the practice of animancy a possible cause to the Legacy, and they have taken to the streets of Defiance Bay and the dirt roads of many distant settlements to make their case to the general public. Some point to this as one source of a recent surge in vigilantism and violence in the country."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No other land has such a wild and bloody recent history. From colony to palatinate to free republic, the Dyrwood has undergone a trial by fire to emerge as a powerful force of the Eastern Reach.

Dyrwood's history actually begins in Aedyr in 2602 AI. Aedyre explorers returned from a journey across the ocean with tales of the treasures they'd found. They'd discovered countless ruins scattered through the forests as well as plains to the north of the trees that would be perfect for growing vorlas. There was a problem, however - the locals were hostile and there was potential for conflict. The fercönyng of Aedyr (FAYR-cö-ning, "first king") knew that this was too good an opportunity to pass up and sent more explorers to scout and map the area.

Exploration continued over the next twenty years. Small groups of explorers traveled back and forth between Aedyr and this new world with a handful of colonists setting up small camps to establish a base for the explorers to work out of. Conflicts with the locals - who the Aedyrans learned are called the Glanfathans - were rare, but frequent enough for the fercönyng to send a small squadron of guards to help protect his citizens. These guards established a central base on a river in the western section of the woods. This settlement would eventually become the city of Dyrford (upon which the modern day village of the same name is presently built). Once that base was established, the first permanent Aedyran settlements began north and west of the Bael River. Over the next three years, thousands of Aedyrans made the trek from Aedyr to this new land. The Glanfathans, who seemed to revere the ruins scattered through the forest, caused a few problems with some of the settlements - especially those founded near the ruins themselves. These were easily taken care of by the colonists with the help of the imperial guard. The Aedyrans, in order to further their foothold in the area, reduced the cost of production, and in an attempt to keep the Glanfathan population under control, started making slaves out of any Glanfathans captured during the uprisings. This resulted in a great increase in tension between the two groups.

With the population of the area growing, an official governmental structure was established by the fercönyng. He appointed several erls to preside over the land and assigned them thayns to help run their territories, and they called the new gréfram the Dyrwood. Dyrford remained the center for the imperial guard, but the settlement in Pearlwood Gulf, New Dunryd, was the true seat of power for the area. Sitting at the edge of the ocean, forest, fertile farmland, and a river that runs from the coast to the White March, settlers flocked to the area, hoping to establish names for themselves. Aedyr began to spread across the new land."

      <DefaultText>"As I have stated, not much is known about this group by the world at large because they don't welcome outsiders into their numbers. While many believe they are xenophobic and openly hostile to all who enter Eir Glanfath, the truth doesn't seem to be as broad or deadly - and certainly not that simple. 

There are many places in Eir Glanfath that could be called ‘magical’ or ‘sacred’ to the Glanfathans. One legend states that the Engwithans, who had suddenly abandoned their kingdom and left for places unknown, took the time to guide the ancient Glanfathan tribes into the now vacant land. The Glanfathans were gifted with the fertile area as their new homeland, but in return for being given such a gift, an oath was required. The Glanfathans were instructed to protect the Engwithan ruins until such time as they could return and reclaim the ruins. They were required to swear that no living person, including the Glanfathans themselves, would be permitted entrance into the ruins. Differing accounts suggest that the Glanfathans were promised more than a homeland - that the Engwithans were the favored people of the gods, and that keeping their oaths would confer similar benefits to the Glanfathans in the end. 

Oddly, the rules do not seem to apply as strictly within the borders of Twin Elms, a site built upon a large concentration of Engwithan structures. But it would seem that this is unlikely a selective oversight on the part of the Glanfathans and more probably part of the terms of the original compact.

In any case, the Glanfathans came to take their role as guardians seriously, revering the sites and developing rituals designed to protect and guard the ruins. Over time, these rituals became rote formality to some, as much legend and superstition as any other stories passed down. This is not to say the Glanfathans ceased all attempts to uphold their oath (see the section about the Ten Years Treaties in my book about Admeth Hadret), but the intense devotion to the oath tended to vary from tribe to tribe and clan to clan. Not so with the Fangs, however. The Fangs are a group joined not by ties of kinship or even community, but of belief. Of all the groups of Eir Glanfath, it is the Fangs who seem most intent on keeping the promise their ancestors made to the Engwithans.

Just because their fanaticism and zeal are not as widely sweeping as many think does not make them any less dangerous. The Fangs are not known to reason with those they view as transgressors. If they feel you have in any way have violated the sanctity of a sacred space, their judgment is swift and exact. Reports of the Fangs attacks can be found in records dating back to the first colonial explorations of Eir Glanfath, and even the smallest of a perceived slight can be worthy of execution.

The order itself seems to consist mainly of hunters. Whether they are recruited as skilled hunters or trained once they gain access to the order, it is unknown. From all accounts, once they join the Fangs, hunting game falls second behind patrolling Eir Glanfath and protecting the ruins, so it is the author’s opinion that it is the former."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One day, Eothas was sitting on a wall, watching a cat play in the sun. A crystal, hung in a nearby tree, had fragmented a sunbeam and scattered small motes of light on the ground. They danced around the cat, sliding over him as he frantically batted at them. He spun in place, following one as it rushed past him, and leaped on it, trying to pin it down. Eothas smiled, amused at the animal's tenacity. The cat landed on a spot, placing his paws over it only to watch it flit away again. Eothas watched the cat's tail twitch and slap at the ground, annoyed that his prey could not be pinned.

‘Why must you tease him?' a voice said from behind him, accompanied by the crunch of sandals on gravel.

‘I merely bring the dawn,' Eothas responded. ‘I don't stoke the hunter's heart. That's your responsibility, isn't it?'

‘True,' said a second voice, ‘but neither do you quell it. If the hunter could not see his prey, would he still hunt?'

‘So philosophical, Hylea,' Eothas said and turned to greet the two gods that approached him. ‘Have you come to debate the parallel between sight and desire?' He gestured to the wall, inviting Hylea and Galawain to join him. They sat in silence, watching the cat who continued to hunt the sun, fruitlessly swatting at another mote and then rolling onto his back.

‘I have created the ultimate prey,' Eothas said finally, breaking the silence. ‘It can be tracked. It can be followed. It can be seen. But it can never be caught.' Galawain laughed lightly. ‘You don't agree, Galawain?' Eothas asked.

‘While it's true that your creation is elusive, it hardly can be considered the ultimate prey because it never can be caught.' He paused, his brow furrowed in thought. ‘If that mote of light had substance, the hunter could subdue it. Otherwise, it's merely a dream - truly a fruitless endeavor.'

‘All creatures spend their lives chasing fruitless endeavors,' said Hylea. ‘It is the way of mortality.' Galawain laughed again.

‘I could create a creature - a living creature of flesh and blood - that could never be caught. I make your dream a reality.' Now it was Eothas' turn to laugh.

‘You propose turning a fruitless dream into a fruitless reality! How is this any better?'

‘A life spent in the pursuit of an attainable goal far exceeds any other.'

‘But you just said no one could catch this creature! This is not attainable!'

Galawain smiled. ‘Humanity has surprised us before. Indeed it could surprise us again. I will create a great white stag and I will set it free in the world. It will have grace, resilience, and tenacity. It will exist solely to be pursued for all its days, and it will never be caught. It will serve to inspire the hunt for generations to come. All those who wish for glory will invoke my name. All those who hear its story will ask for my blessing in finding it.'

Hylea shook her head, and threw Galawain a bemused look. ‘I do not believe this is possible. So I, too, make an offer. To the person who catches this stag - and they will catch the stag - I will bestow upon them its grace, resilience, and tenacity. Thrice blessed they will be. They will ask for my blessing on the hunt so they can obtain my boon.'

Galawain and Hylea took up arguing whose name would be invoked more when the hunt was on. Eothas sighed, a small smile playing at the edges of his mouth. He stood and looked to the sky. The sun had already started to hide itself behind the mountains. The cat, long ago tired of the stalking the motes, had fallen asleep beneath the tree. He turned and looked at the other gods, deep in debate, and sighed again.

‘I merely bring the dawn,' he repeated as he made his way down the path, ‘it is up to you to see what I reveal.'"

      <DefaultText>"Look up into the night sky and you'll see the moon Belafa. Ubiquitous and persistent, she remains forever in view but also forever out of reach. What many people do not know, however is that our world is actually orbited by two moons: Belafa and Cawldha.

Belafa

Hanging low and large in the sky, Belafa travels swiftly in her race around the world - completing an orbit in about eighteen days. This proximity and speed can cause extreme tide conditions in some areas, making the seas shift so quickly and rise so high that there are some beautiful coastal areas that are virtually uninhabitable for a good portion of the year. Before we learned the truth behind the cause of the tides, legend held that Ondra, the goddess of the sea, was in love with the moon and when she saw it in the sky the tides, great waves, and violent storms that happened were her attempts to reach it. This is why the moon is formally called Senn Belafa or Ondran Belafa - The Beloved or Ondra's Beloved.

Cawldha

315 years ago, the Grand Empire of Vailia suffered from terrible storms and terrifyingly high and low tides. Records show the same thing was happening in the Aedyr Empire and that several new Aedyran colonies along the Dyrwood coast were completely destroyed by storms and high tides that engulfed the settlements. At that time, during an eclipse, Glanfathan astronomers spotted something small orbiting near the edge of Belafa.

After much study, they realized it was a small satellite with an extremely irregular orbit. They called it Cawldha Debh, or The Black Runner. Since it is smaller than Belafa, it doesn't have much effect on the world, but when it aligns with Belafa's orbit, it wreaks havoc on the tides and weather everywhere. This happens with an erratic frequency and severity and have been dubbed ‘Lovers' Tides.’ Cawldha has been rolled into the Ondra myth and when they are both in sight, her desire to reach them is increased tenfold, which is what causes the terrible weather."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There is much debate with historians as to when the Saint's War really began. It is widely accepted that the event that instigated it was the sanctuary flight of Readceran citizens to the Dyrwood. This led to direct strife between the two nations that escalated into battle - The Saint's War.

But it is the author’s opinion that the war truly started many years before.

After the Miracle of the Verdant Vorlas (as it came to be known), Waidwen quickly gathered followers, drawn to the stories of Eothas' miraculous prophet. His power grew. Eventually, Waidwen had gained enough support that he confronted the imperial governor. 

Assisted by a collection knights and nobles who had been swayed to his cause, he marched on the capital city. The governor was allowed to live, but was forced to abdicate power and leave the colony. This was not from any understanding or easy acquiescence from the governor, but because of what happened when Waidwen entered the governor's palace. As Waidwen approached the governor, according to accounts, his body turned into something that was no longer human. His flesh became luminescent and his head transformed into pure, blinding light. (Other accounts suggest that Waidwen had become a being of light at an earlier time, when he was whipped in the public square. The outcome of his visit to the palace, however, is uncontested.)

The governor, knowing there was no way he could oppose an avatar of Eothas, relinquished his power. The people then asked Waidwen to lead the colony. He accepted, earning him the name ‘Divine King’ of Readceras.

Waidwen's rule was virtually uncontested. Initially this was because everyone was awed that a god had chosen to manifest himself and lead his people. This changed as Waidwen began punishing the allies of the old empire and the ‘poison on the world’ - what he considered corrupt churches or church leaders of Eothas. Scrutiny escalated and soon worshipers of Eothas were also being punished for mere perceptions of heresy. Members of other religions were also added to the list of the persecuted for following different faiths. This caused large segments of the population to flee Readceras for the Dyrwood, begging for sanctuary. This caused strife between the two nations. The people of the Dyrwood knew that they could not sustain explosive population growth if Waidwen's rule were to continue unchecked. They also feared that his eye would turn from Readceras and land on them next if nothing was done. This was exactly what ultimately happened, and open war broke out as Waidwen moved to spread his dominion into the lands of Dyrwood."

      <DefaultText>"How long have I been wandering? I can no longer tell. The days in endless white, the cold breath of the wilderness biting at my neck. All I feel is the insistent hand of the wind pushing me forward. Where is it taking me?

Where did it start? On the boat? Was there a boat? I remember one. A storm? And disaster. If I dwell on it long enough, my mind rebels. So I walk. And she appears to me.

How many times has it been? Once? Have I seen her before or is this the first time? Did she ever leave? All my mind can do is ask questions. Each question leads to another question. The answers frighten me.

So I walk.

She stands with her head cast down. Long, white hair hangs in front of her face, obscuring it from my view. She holds out a hand. Pale. Thin. Palm up. She wants my help.

She wants my soul.

Something screams, inhuman and primal. It overtakes me from behind, wrapping me in a terrifying blanket of sound. My skin contracts as chills course through me. I turn to face my pursuer and see only a vast, white emptiness.

She is gone, like every time before. Was this the first time? Has she gone before? My stomach answers with a growl. Hunger. The beast consumes me from the inside and there is no stopping it. I must eat.

I see water. Am I seeing it now? Is this a memory? Confusion slips its fingers inside my head and murmurs softly. I cannot quite hear it. I strain to no avail. The water remains. It must be here. I drop to my knees and hear the whisper-light crack of the ice beneath my knees.

I am sitting in the lee of an ice mountain. The protection it provides does little to prevent the wind from driving the pins of snow into my flesh. I am shaking. Where is my left hand? I move it. Nothing. I look down and see it moving. It is wet and caked with ice. My head falls back against the ice and I press the edges of my memory. My brain whispers back with a soft cracking sound and a scream. Wood on wood. Tearing. Cracking. I close my eyes against the onslaught.

She appears before me again. Again? Time fragments and blows around me like the snow that obscures my vision. I am walking. My hand is on fire. I feel the needles piercing my fingers as she reaches hers out to me. She raises her head, black eyes staring blankly. Her mouth opens and closes - but if she speaks, I cannot hear it.

The scream again. Closer this time. If I still had emotion, I would be quaking. I turn as I have so many times before to see what monster has found me and she is there behind me. She puts her hand on my chest. The cold burns me through my clothes. She leans in, her mouth presses against my ear.

‘We are waiting.’

I open my eyes. I lie on the ground. I see torn fabric, rocks, a broken wooden box. An unsuccessful campfire. Where did it come from? Did I make it? How did I get here? I roll onto my back, unable to stand. Exhaustion sits on my chest and holds me down.

She stands above me. I see frozen tears on her cheeks. She does not move. She does not threaten me. But I know this is the end. Her mouth opens. The inhuman scream that erupts from within her digs through the blackness that shrouds my mind and I see her. The wood that tore beneath her feet. The water that swallowed her.

She fades, replaced by the face of the devil that has followed me. Was it always there? In my madness, did I view it in a different form? Is anything in my mind true? Time bleeds. My vision shimmers, distorting the face that approaches. Its dark eyes watch closely as it walks forward. Its fur is matted and stained. Its fangs glisten in the fading light. Its enormous hands, tipped with jagged blades, rise above my head.

I close my eyes.

‘I am coming.’"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Only the heartiest of explorers would dare take the long, dangerous trek to the Living Lands. While there is no denying its beauty - the diversity of plant life alone is an herbologist’s dream - the inherent risk in blithely trekking through these pristine hills is more than most should undertake.

Let me take a moment to tell you about the land itself - rolling hills, greenery, and sun. The whole area feels like a succession of hills and valleys, each with its own ecosystem. While that declaration is a tad extreme, it can almost be said to be true. The combination of sun, geographical location, proximity to fresh water, valley depth, and the existence of hot springs have given the Living Lands a wide breadth of flora and fauna. Walk down a hillside into a valley and you will find lush, verdant hills. Climb the next rise and you might see nothing but rock and boiling mineral springs. 

And the creatures! In my travels, I've seen it all and this place never ceases to amaze me!

Trolls

I will never forget my encounter with the trolls of the Living Lands. I had just narrowly avoided being consumed by a giant plant (more on that later) and was running as fast as I could to get away from it. I broke the crest of the hill and the valley below was wide, green, wet, and covered with low, thick-branched trees. Vines grew everywhere! Between the trees, across the tops of them, down to the ground - it as a mess of vine and green. Cautiously, I worked my way down toward the basin, keeping an eye out for anything suspicious. And it's a good thing I did so! I noticed not all the trees appeared to be trees. I froze, dropping to the ground in an effort to minimize my appearance. One of the trees moved, lumbering slowly away from the cluster. It's then that I realized it was a troll, stepping out from among the group of trees it had been resting against. With a few more steps, I would have walked right into their home! The camouflage these trolls exhibited far exceed any I had ever seen before. I hope to return again in the future and observe them more.

Insects

While I have never seen them, I have read reports of giant insects in the Living Lands. Centipedes, flies, mosquitoes, and hornets all ten times the size you would see them elsewhere! Imagine making camp - you've just gotten everything set up. There's a nice fire going next to your shelter. Something is gently simmering in the cooking pot. You sit down, finally feeling like you can relax after a trying day. You feel a tickling at your feet, insistent and prolonged. Reaching down to brush whatever it is away, your hand comes in contact with something hard, long, and flexible winding its way around your boot. You look down to see a centipede the size of your arm casually making its way over your feet, toward the far side of your camp. You would get out of that camp, wouldn't you? That's exactly what my friend did when he realized he had started his fire over a centipede nest.

Plants

And lest we forget - do not let your guard down around the plants! I had discovered a wonderful collection of giant flowers. They were bright pink and grew in a circle around a central stalk. What an aroma! I lack the words to describe how delectable it was. Sweet, fruity, and light with just a hint of something tangy. Looking closer, I saw some berries growing on the stalk in the center of the flowers. Well, I just had to have them! So I started pushing my way through the flowers. Then the vines growing around the base of the plant began to twitch and the blooms turned toward me. It was at that moment I saw the blooms weren't actually flowers, but hinged jaws! I had been fooled by its camouflage! I quickly retreated, pushing my way back out - just in time. The blooms slammed shut. If I had still been standing there, trying in vain to reach the berries, I wouldn't be writing this book today."</DefaultText>

LAIA: Behold, now comes the fun,
That for which I have waited.
His love is forfeit, her life is forfeit
And all I have worked toward shall be fulfilled.
He says he knows his love
He says no force in the world could keep him from her
But what chance has force against guile?
Never will he find his love for she is no longer his love
The spell cannot be undone except by her death
And by then, it will be too late.
But, wait, he has seen her!

Laia steps back to observe.

FAVIA: Pray, mortal, why have you come here?
These woods are not for your kind.
The affairs of men have no place at this tree.
Leave. Leave ere your welcome lapses!

BERNAT: Foul creature!
Where is my love? What have you done with her?
Always this has been the station for our encounters.
Never before have I seen you.
Where is my love?
Answer. Answer ere my patience lapses!

Your presence never before has been felt.
Again I say to you leave!
My generosity will not be extended a third time.

I know the way to hurry the conclusion of this tale!

Laia takes a breath and extends her throat as if she's yelling, a scream comes from the copse of trees where the pŵgra stands.

BERNAT: My love!

Bernat steps forward, brandishing his sword.

BERNAT: Prepare yourself, wretch!
For not even death can stand between me and my love.
I will have her from you
Or you will meet your end.

Bernat moves toward Favia, who closes to fight. They fight. During the fight, Bernat is grievously injured as he delivers the killing blow to Favia. She falls to the ground and as she dies, the spell on her breaks, transforming her back into her delemgan form.

FAVIA: Bernat. Bernat.
My Bernat, my love, what have you done to me?
What was it I said?
What was it I did?
Has our love soured in your heart?

BERNAT: Favia! My love! My life!
What foul sorcery has befallen you?
How have you come to be laid low by my hand?
Fie!
Fie to the gods for such treachery!
Fie to all who stood in our way!

FAVIA: Fear not, my beloved
For now we are together
And together will always will be.
Nothing can keep us apart.
But, lo!
Why is it suddenly so dark? Where has the sun gone?
Where are you? I cannot see you.
I will find you.
I will...

Favia dies.

BERNAT: A curse upon the fiend who has betrayed me!
To hold love in your hand and have it wrenched away.

Bernat winces and puts his hand in his shirt, it comes out covered in blood.

BERNAT: What luck! What chance!
Tragedy may yet turn to fortune!
Favia, my love! Soon I will rest in your arms!
We will lie together again as one and forever shall we be side by side!
I go now to meet my love.
Berath, I accept your cold embrace.
I welcome your company.
I beg your mercy.

Bernat lies down next to Favia's body.

BERNAT: I am ready.

Bernat dies.

Laia steps out from her hiding spot and runs to Bernat's body.

LAIA: Bernat! You fool! You wretch!
How can you leave me?
I am alone! I am forgotten! I am cast out!
Without your love, how can I continue?
Life holds no thrall without your visage upon which I may gaze.
What shall I do?
But here! My salvation! My answer!

Laia picks up Bernat's sword.

LAIA: His blade. His weapon.
I shall be impaled upon him and he shall cut through me.
I will not be denied my love!
I will not be denied, my love!
You will be mine! If not in this life, then in the next!

Laia impales herself on the sword.

LAIA: I come for you, my love, my Bernat!
Wait for me and I will find you!
We shall love forever!

      <DefaultText>"In 2626 AI, a group of farmers, while clearing farmland for planting, accidentally knocked down one of the ancient adra menhirs on their land. This innocent act drew the ire of the native population and started what would come to be known as the Broken Stone War. When it was finally over, several thousand colonists have been killed as well as hundreds of the Glanfathans. Even though the war was technically over, the Glanfathans escalated their attacks on the settlers over the next two years using vicious tactics that left many colonists, several military figures, an erl, and six thayns dead.

Unable to stop the Glanfathan attacks, the erls elected erl Edrang Hadret to the position of gréf . Well respected and known to be a master of military tactics, he was tasked with dealing with the Glanfathan threat. Edrang fought with the Glanfathans, led by an orlan named Regd, for the next two years. Neither side can gain the upper hand on the other resulting in a tense stalemate between the two groups. Because of this stalemate, the hostilities slowly died off and in 2631, the Dyrwoodan people signed a treaty with the Glanfathans. Regd would step down, the Glanfathans would stop their attacks altogether, and the Dyrwoodan people would leave the ruins alone. This treaty angered the nobility in Aedyr, as it brought to a halt the supply of artifacts. Edrang also tried to get the practice of slavery outlawed, but this was not successful. Because of this, the peace between the Dyrwood and Eir Glanfath is uneasy and tumultuous. Small patches of rural violence still cropped up, but were easily dealt with, as neither side wanted another war."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"After the Broken Stone War, the Dyrwood would see peace and prosperity for 21 years. Aside from the occasional slave uprising or border dispute, nothing of any note happened until 2652 AI. Some of the Dyrwoodan erls, tired of being restricted by the treaties, and encouraged by imperial sources, defied the decrees and actively sent people to loot the ruins in the Dyrwood. Response from the Glanfathans was not immediate, but when it came it was brutal and bloody. There was a slave uprising and Regd resumed control of his guerrilla fighters. A contingent of delemgan joined the forces as well, making the fights in the forest even more deadly for the Dyrwoodan soldiers.

Edrang, then far too old to lead Dyrwood in the war, sent his son Admeth to deal with the situation. Admeth, showing the same tactical prowess as his father, set fire to the forest at the Isce Uar River and then blocks the forces retreating from the inferno. Some of the Glanfathans escape, but thousands would die in the blaze. Regd is captured and sent to holding in New Heomar. The goes on for several months and Admeth uses this same tactic many times to flush Glanfathans and delemgan from the battlefield. The entire war lasts less than a year. The Dyrwood eventually wins, but at a terrible price. This conflict would come to be known as The War of Black Trees.

Tragedy struck the Dyrwood in 2654 when Edrang, whose health had been waning, succumbed and passed into the Cycle. Regd, who had developed a begrudging respect for his constant adversary over the years they had fought, sent Admeth his sincere condolences from captivity in New Heomar. Admeth assumed his father's place as gréf  over the Dyrwood. The other erls disliked this development and began publicly rebuking Admeth's decrees. In 2655 AI, Admeth, tired of the problems caused by the recalcitrant erls, but having support of the new Vailian ducs and the common folk of Dyrwood (having saved them from the Glanfathans) delivers an ultimatum to the fercönyng of Aedyr. He demands to be made a gréf  palatine. This move would give him authority and power over all the erls, their holdings, and their titles. Dyrwood would become a palatinate instead of a gréfram. The fercönyng, who did not want to have to deal with a rebellion while trying to establish a hold on the vorlas trade network in Readceras, begrudgingly agreed to Admeth's demands. Admeth would use this new power to bring all the erls in line. As a trade-off for being given the power, Admeth put money and resources into all of the Dyrwood's ports to increase shipping traffic. In turn, this increased the fercönyng's income.

Under Admeth's rule, the Dyrwood saw seven productive and profitable years. In 2662 AI, he did what had been tried for many years without success - bringing slavery to an end in the Dyrwood. He negotiated the ‘Ten Years’ treaties (so called because it has been ten years since The War of Black Trees). A timeline was established in which the slaves will be released. The owners would be compensated with money or land for each slave released. If they did not comply, the slaves would be taken and a fine will be levied against the owner. In return, the Glanfathans would open trade with the Dyrwood and cede some of their territories to the Dyrwoodan government (in practice meaning they would stop contesting the presence of those who lived and ruled there). Hundreds of coopers attempted to rebel against this. Admeth, expecting just such a reaction, reacted accordingly and the rebellion was quickly crushed. His agents then spread propaganda through the populace, making the Coopers' Rebellion and its instigators seemed far worse than they truly were. This tactic worked and there would be no more trouble."</DefaultText>

A tragic breakthrough of sorts happened in 2704 AI. An animancer working in Baelreach accidentally shattered the souls of about a dozen volunteers who had been helping him. In retaliation for the deaths, the citizens of the area stormed his house and killed him. The erl of the region, not wanting to waste resources or anger the locals any more than they already were, did nothing to find the head of the vigilante mob, but neither did he outlaw animancy. To ensure their own safety, most animancers moved from the rural areas where they were studying and settled in Defiance Bay, many of them choosing the emerging and wealthy district of Brackenbury as their new home of operations. 

While there were still a few breakthroughs and the study of animancy continued for the next 24 years, it quickly slowed as it became cost-prohibitive and complicated the more people learned about it. Most animancers couldn't afford to continue research without the support of donations or gifts from wealthy individuals and organizations. In 2737 AI, some animancers, desperate to continue their studies and seeing no other means of furthering their research, entered the forbidden ruins of Eir Glanfath to further their research. They discovered some such sites had strange artifacts that seemed to bear affinity to soul essence, and began to prod at the devices for further insight. Even with continued research, they are unable to tell quite what they have discovered. Eventually they were found out by the Glanfathans, who captured some of them, demanding they be punished for their crimes. The Dyrwoodan authorities, in order to maintain their treaties and keep the peace, had no choice - they allowed the animancers to be executed according to Glanfathan tradition. This led the duc to make an additional proclamation - the study and practice of animancy on, or even near, the sacred Glanfathan sites, would be punishable by death.

In 2780 AI, in order to solidify relations again with the Glanfathans, the Dyrwoodan government allowed some animancers to begin training and experiments in conjunction with the Glanfathan ‘mind hunters’ - their native ciphers. This was an exchange of information. The animancers documented the secrets of the mind hunters powers. The mind hunters learned new techniques for concentration which assisted them in taking their powers to a level no Glanfathan had seen before. The ciphers, no longer wary of the animancers intentions, trusted them to such a level that they convinced the Glanfathans to give some animancers limited access to some of the training sites where the Glanfathans practiced. The anamfaths of the Glanfathan tribes opened the training grounds to the animancers. They were not allowed inside - as this was still strictly forbidden - but the general allowances by the Glanfathans were seen as a breakthrough in relations between the Dyrwood and Eir Glanfath. Over the next eight years, the animancers’ research would continue unimpeded. With the exception of some minor squabbles, there has been no major strife between the two groups for almost 120 years since."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In 2807 AI, war returned to the Dyrwood. St. Waidwen, transformed supposedly into a living incarnation of Eothas, marched on the Dyrwood from Readceras, beginning The Saint's War. The Dyrwood rallied at Halgot Citadel and took the battle to him in Readceras, attempting to prevent as much damage to their own land as they could. Even though there were devastating losses for the Dyrwoodan forces, using Hadret's military techniques combined with Galven Regd's strategies, they were able to secure a few victories for themselves as well. Readceran forces made their way into the Dyrwood through White March - unopposed by the locals at Cold Morn - leaving Mercy Vale burned and devastated. The contempt the Dyrwoodans have for Cold Morn for this betrayal lasts well after the war ends.

Desperate to end the war and eliminate St. Waidwen, the Magranic clergy of Dyrwood developed a special bomb that was hidden beneath the bridge at Halgot Citadel. Intending to lure Waidwen to the bridge and then detonate it. Their ploy succeeded and St. Waidwen was completely destroyed, along with most of the forces with him and the entire bridge. The twelve Dyrwoodan men and women who volunteered to delay St. Waidwen on the bridge were also lost, their sacrifice and martyrdom celebrated by the Dyrwood in the ensuing years. The bomb would come to be known as the Godhammer, and soon after the battle, the citadel was renamed ‘Godhammer Citadel.’ St. Waidwen's forces were easily routed after his death and the Dyrwood set about rebuilding from the first major conflict in over a century. In retaliation for St. Waidwen's action on Eothas' part, many Eothasian followers were purged from Dyrwoodan communities or driven out via social pressure.

Less than a year after the devastation of The Saint's War, tragedy hit again. In 2809 AI, the first Hollowborn was reported in the Dyrwood. Many of these poor creatures died within weeks or months of being born. The outcry from the populace calls for blame or punishment be leveled against someone, whether it be the gods, the mothers, the government, or the Eothasian followers. 

Responding to great sociopolitical pressure to try and help the Hollowborn, animancers developed a process to transplant animal souls into the infants, that they might develop survival instincts and even a basic personality. The process seemed successful, so it was repeated on tens of thousands of Hollowborn, even though many animancers disagreed with the technique, worried about the ethical implications. These protests were largely ignored and discounted. The process was soon named "Salvation" and the Hollowborn given souls this way were called the "Saved."

Five years after the first Hollowborn - an orlan girl - is saved, she entered puberty. In a matter of mere weeks, she transformed into a ravenous, feral creature devoid of all conscience. Soon, all of the Saved would experience the same fate. Each one, upon reaching puberty, would transform into what the locals called ‘wichts’ (uncontrollable children). After researching the problem, animancers discovered an incompatibility between the animal souls and the children’s bodies. This fueled the parents' anger (as many of them had to kill their wicht children). The animancers responsible were widely denounced and many of them were dragged from their homes, beaten, and - in many case - killed. Most surviving animancers left the rural areas en masse and headed to Defiance Bay. Others left the area completely, moving to the Vailian Republics to study in peace."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The rural communities loved Admeth Hadret, considering him the best leader they'd ever had. In Aedyr, the fercönyng rankled against his usurpations of imperial authority, but no longer had the necessary power to truly undo anything that had happened.

Two years later, in 2664 AI, the fercönyng found allies willing to explore the ruins (against the treaty conditions) and plundered them for their artifacts. This was done discretely at first, but they eventually became careless. The agents were discovered and arrested, but there was no evidence pointing back to the fercönyng. Admeth, suspecting the truth, used Glanfathan brishalgwin (‘mind hunters’) - the progenitors of modern day ciphers - to investigate the matter further. With this method of interrogation, he discovered a chain of evidence all the way back to the fercönyng. While he investigated, many rural communities suffered retaliatory attacks by Glanfathans.

Armed with this new information, Admeth worked with Galven Medhra (the new leader of the Glanfathans) and the rural communities of the Dyrwood to prevent the fercönyng's agents from entering the ruins. There was a back and forth between the two groups, both sides engaging in various political, economic, and military maneuvers to try and gain the upper hand. The fercönyng was at a disadvantage in this game, though, as he preferred to assert his authority without causing an uprising.

Eventually Admeth had enough. He convinced seven of the nine erls to join him and they severed their allegiance to the fercönyng, declaring themselves independent and decree they would govern themselves, just as the Vailian republics did twenty years prior. Admeth told the people he had tired of policies that made the nobles rich while putting the people of the Dyrwood at risk. He declared himself a duc (again, modeled after the Vailian Republic's governing structure) and called the Dyrwood a ‘free’ palatinate. Thus began The War of Defiance in 2668 AI. The war lasted four years and caused countless casualties, including Admeth himself. The Dyrwoodans, with their Glanfathan allies were able to persevere. Glanfathan astrologers, alongside the Dyrwoodan forces and members of the ad hoc Knights of the Crucible militia, won the Battle of Defiance Bay, which became the last battle of the war and left Dyrwood free from Aedyran imperial rule. Seven of the nine erls of the Dyrwood survived and, unified in purpose, signed treaties with the fercönyng of Aedyr. The war gave the Dyrwood a greater sense of unity between its citizens and their Glanfathan allies. Admeth Hadret was revered by both groups and the Dyrwood enjoyed for the first time a nationwide fellowship of independence, perseverance, and sacrifice. Yenwood and Cwynsrun were dissolved and incorporated into the surrounding erldoms, leaving seven - Helsgate, The Grasp, Tenferths, Norwaech, Coldwater, Ashfall, and Baelreach. New Dunryd was renamed Defiance Bay and would become the seat of power for the new duc in Baelreach. The new duc’s rule began in 2672 AI."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In 2602 AI, Aedyran explorers returned from over the ocean, telling tales of the ruins and treasures there and of expansive fields that were perfect for growing vorlas. The explorers warned the fercönyng that the locals were not friendly to outsiders, but the fercönyng, seeing this as an opportunity to extend his empire and secure trade on another continent, sent more explorers. Over the next twenty years, the area that would become the Dyrwood was investigated, mapped, and colonized. In 2623, the first permanent Aedyran colonial settlements were established.

Vorlas fields were set up north of the forests in the Dyrwood, but between the conflicts with the Glanfathans and the War of the Broken Stone, it floundered. It wasn’t until 2643 that the opportunity presented itself again. Some Eothasian pilgrims, wanting to escape persecution, established colonies and vorlas farming operations in the territory of Readceras. With Grand Vailia on the verge of collapse, the fercönyng wanted to ensure his hold on the purple dye trade would be established. He encouraged the settlement and even paid to have the pilgrims set up in the new world.

Because the fercönyng was still trying to secure his name in the purple dye trade, he was unable to properly respond to Admeth Hadret when he issued his ultimatum. To avoid a rebellion and leave himself time to oversee the vorlas farms in Readceras, the fercönyng relented and made Admeth a gréf  palatine. In return for this concession, Admeth spent time and resources on the Dyrwood's trade and shipping routes, benefiting the fercönyng with increased income.

For seven years, the Dyrwood provided Aedyr with a steady income, leaving the fercönyng time to ensure his trade system in Readceras was strong. With the fercönyng's attention elsewhere, Admeth instituted the ‘Ten Years’ treaties, ending slavery in the Dyrwood and permanently removing one of the revenue sources provided by the Dyrwoodan explorers - the artifacts from the ruins scattered throughout the Dyrwood. At this point, the fercönyng's word meant almost nothing to the citizens of the Dyrwood. Admeth Hadret had replaced him as their true leader.

In order to undermine Admeth's standing, the fercönyng found allies willing to explore the ruins (against the treaty conditions) and plunder them. Soon, Aedyr again had a supply of artifacts to sell. When his agents were eventually caught, the fercönyng distanced himself from the operation, certain there was no way to link him to the proceedings.

But the gréf , using means provided to him by his Glanfathan allies, discovered the evidence needed to prove the fercönyng was behind the plunderers. The conflict that arose from this revelation led to Admeth declaring independence for the Dyrwood in 2668 AI. After a bloody four-year-long war that resulted in the death of Admeth, the fercönyng relented. Trying to keep control of the Dyrwood had become too costly. He signed treaties with the new duc of the Dyrwood and returned his attention to Readceras, redoubling efforts on the vorlas trade, which is still running today."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In 2652, everything started to deteriorate. It was uncovered that a number of ruin sites had been looted and all signs pointed to the Aedyrans breaking the treaty. Glanfathans held off judgment for as long as they could, but when the evidence became overwhelming, they retaliated with all the strength they could muster. Regd once again took up the mantle of leadership and led his people against the Aedyrans. Instead of facing Edrang Hadret again, this time Regd crossed swords with Admeth Hadret, Edrang's son. Admeth proved to be just as, if not more, capable than his father and used a tactic no Glanfathan expected. In order to clear out the battlefield and ensure there would be no place for troops to hide, Admeth set the entire forest on fire near the Isce Uar River, and blocked all retreating forces with his army. While some escaped the slaughter, most of the Glanfathan troops died. Regd was captured in the mayhem and transferred to New Heomar for holding. While many more battles occurred - some of which resulted in Admeth using the same tactic - the Glanfathan forces were now disorganized and had lost their resolve. They were easily routed and by the end of that same year, the War of the Black Trees (as it is now known) was over.

In order to again repair relations between the two groups, Admeth introduced new laws restricting the taking of new slaves from Eir Glanfath. The laws also gave Glanfathans the opportunity to buy their fellows out of bondage. While not entirely happy with the prospect of having to buy their countrymen - who had already been free - the Glanfathans took this gesture as the good will it was and ceased their hostilities again. Seven years pass with the Dyrwood under Admeth's rule. The Glanfathans felt, for the first time, that true peace could return to their land. This peace lead to what is likely the biggest treaty negotiation between Eir Glanfath and the Dyrwood in its history. Admeth set into place the "Ten Years" Treaties (so named because it had been ten years since the War of Black Trees). A timeline was set, and at the end of it all Glanfathan slaves had to be released. The citizens of Eir Glanfath watched the Dyrwood with a cautious hope. With the extended peace between the two peoples and these new treaties, they truly hoped conflict was a thing of the past.

In 2665, Galven Medhra, an elven woman who had taken over for Regd, brought news to Admeth. Some Dyrwoodan people were found taking artifacts from one of the tombs. Initial investigation uncovered several more that had already been plundered. As they seemed to be isolated incidents and it had been stopped early, Medhra did not want a war to start again after so long being at peace. Admeth was grateful for this courtesy and wasted no time tracking down who was responsible. Medhra gave Admeth use of her brishalgwin ‘mind hunters’ and with their help found evidence pointing directly back to the fercönyng. Admeth and Medhra, now jointly allied against the Aedyran fercönyng, used everything at their disposal to prevent the fercönyng's agents from getting into the ruins.

In 2668 AI, when Admeth declared independence from Aedyr to create the Free Palatinate of Dyrwood, the Glanfathans stood behind him, offering their support and troops. While the war didn't affect the Glanfathan people directly, there were casualties. In the end, the Dyrwoodan people became free and the bond between the two people was strengthened through their shared suffering. Admeth became the beloved as ruler of the Dyrwood - known and respected by Dyrwoodans and Glanfathans alike."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Commander and Forge Master

Once a path is chosen, the Knight's life is spent training in his preferred discipline. The pomp and formalities that surrounded his life up to this point are all but gone. The training is far more rigorous and there is less ceremony to mark his progress. For most Knights, Commander (Body) or Forge Master (Soul) are further than they will ever advance. The training of a Knight at this level, while almost exclusively in the discipline he has chosen, is still rounded out with instruction from the other. A Knight is not truly a Knight if he does not have a full breadth of knowledge. When he passes from Justiciar to Commander, the Knight is given a blue cape to wear with his plate armor. When a Templus rises to the position of Forge Master, he is presented with a white cloak.

Marshal and Crucilar

After time spent training, an elite Knight that shows true leadership potential and promise is elevated to the next level. A Knight of the Body becomes a Marshal and a Knight of the Soul becomes a Crucilar. At this point, he is in command of a small group of Knights, Commander/Forge Master and below. He is responsible for the recruitment, initiation, and advancement of new Squires. Many Knights do not want to advance to this level and beyond because the role becomes less hands-on and more advisory. Marshals are known by their purple capes while Crucilars are distinguished by a gold cloak. 

Lord Justiciar and Grand Templus

A Marshal or Crucilar that shows true and effective command over the Knights in his keeping may be offered the position of Lord Justiciar (of the Body) or Grand Templus (of the Soul). Truly a command position, a Knight that accepts one of these roles will be removed from the front lines. Because of this, it is only the most dedicated leaders that take either of these positions.

Lord Marshal and Grand Crucilar

There is not a single Knight that oversees the entire group. This responsibility is split between the Lord Marshal (Body) and the Lord Crucilar (Soul). Any Knight that advances to this position does so only with the support of the Knights as a whole. He must be nominated and selected by a majority of the Knights. Once in the position, he is there for life. The Lord Marshal or Lord Crucilar may step down from his post if he so chooses, but that is only to retire from the life of a Knight. The stress and responsibility of this position is such that many refuse it, even if they are capable of handling it. Lord Marshals and Crucilars are well known and generally respected throughout the land, not just within the Knights."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Over the five years following his ascension to gréf , Admeth attempted to mend relations with the Glanfathans and bring his land together with theirs. He enacted laws that restricted the taking of new slaves, allowed Glanfathans to buy their fellows out of bondage, and imposed a tax on slave ownership in order to promote the use of free labor. While there was some resistance to these new laws, the fercönyng's attention to Readceras and Admeth's power (backed by the colonists), made it difficult for the erls to truly resist what was happening.

In 2662 AI, in the year of the tenth anniversary of the War of Black Trees, Admeth brought about the end to slavery in the Dyrwood. He negotiated a series of treaties with the Glanfathans wherein a timeline was established for the official emancipation of all remaining slaves. Each owner would receive compensation in either land or money based on the number of slaves freed. If they didn't comply, the slaves would be seized and their former masters would suffer a substantial fine. In return for this, the Glanfathans opened trade routes with the Dyrwood and allowed Dyrwoodans to live in and near areas that had their sacred ruins but they are, under no conditions, to enter the ruins. As a final act of good will, Admeth freed Galven Regd, saying he had suffered sufficiently for his actions.

The fercönyng, seeing he was completely out of control in his own palatinate, devised a plan to get the supply of ancient artifacts running again. He approached the erls suffering under Admeth's rule and convinced them to hire agents to raid the ruins. Initially, they did so in secret, but they quickly become sloppy, eventually being caught. This breach of the treaties incited Glanfathans again to acts of violence while Admeth researched who was behind it.

With help of the Glanfathan leaders, Admeth found evidence that pointed back to the fercönyng as the source of the raids. That was the beginning of the end for Aedyran rule in the Dyrwood. Over the next seven years, Admeth and the fercönyng maneuvered around each other, playing political, economic, and military games in order to gain the upper hand. In 2668 AI, Admeth declared the Dyrwood had had enough. The fercönyng would no longer be recognized - the Dyrwood was now a free entity and would govern itself. This started the War of Defiance which lasted five years.

The end result of the war was freedom for the Dyrwood, and though Duc Hadret would never live to see it come to a close, the people of Dyrwood consider him the founder of the country nevertheless."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Waidwen personally led many of the battles during the war, exhibiting extraordinary supernatural powers. He seemed virtually untouchable on the battlefield, able to burn or even disintegrate his enemies with beams of blinding, white light. With a god on his side and possibly, as some said, inhabiting him, he was thought to be indestructible.

It appeared that he may have been, until the Battle of Halgot Citadel. The people of the Dyrwood knew they would lose the war if they could not at least slow Waidwen down. Engineers, priests of Magran, and a few others, working in secret (some say with Magran’s direct help), developed a weapon they hoped would be able to stop a god. Twelve feet in diameter and filled with a variety of chemical and magical explosives, the bomb was rolled under Evon Dewr Bridge. Part of the foundation was excavated in order to allow them to embed the bomb in the bridge itself, ensuring its total concealment.

Twelve Dyrwoodan men and women volunteered to stage and ambush at the bridge to keep Waidwen on it until the bomb could be detonated. The battle was short, bloody, and ultimately final. ‘The Dozen’ (as they came to be known) were able to delay Waidwen on the bridge. The bomb detonated, killing Waidwen, the four Dyrwoodan volunteers still alive at that time, and over fifty Readceran soldiers marching on the front line with Waidwen.

It was at that moment The Saint's War ended. The remaining Readceran forces were easy to rout. Even though they had more than enough men and equipment to finish the siege, their leader - previously thought invincible - had just vanished in a rain of metal and stone. Panic set in and the Dyrwoodan troops sent them away with ease.

From that point on, the bomb was known by the name ‘Godhammer.’ It even worked its way into everyday conversation. "As sure as Godhammer ended the Saint's War," came to be a standard phrase to express unequivocal certainty. Less certain is the fate of Eothas, who has not spoken to his followers since the explosion of the bomb and is presumed by most to be dead.

Lest some concerned citizens express their worry or other more industrious think they could reproduce the result, the author would put the thoughts from your heads. Since that time, there has never been another documented explosion of such magnitude, and efforts to locate the engineers and clergy responsible for the bomb have been entirely fruitless. Godhammer was a unique, fortuitous occurrence. Its like will never be seen again without divine intervention."</DefaultText>

INJURED MAN: A balm? A salve? Surely you know compassion. Surely you can spare anything, even your time, to help me!
MALE: This man is injured and cannot help himself. He is certain to die if someone does not apply ointment and bandages to his wounds. Such compassion could mean his life.
FEMALE: You owe nothing to this man. Surely his injuries are the judgment of his god. He has been tried and found wanting. His punishment is none of your concern.

MALE &amp; FEMALE: What will you do?

The man weighs his options, then kneels down beside the Injured Man. He administers ointment on the man's wounds and wraps a bandage around them.

INJURED MAN: Bless you! May the compassion you show to those less fortunate be shown to you all your days!

MALE &amp; FEMALE: Why did you dress the wounds of the injured?

MAN: I saw a man who was bent and broken. It is not for me to say he has no right to his health, only to help heal if I am able. I have the time to give, so I give. If I can help in a man's rebirth, it is my duty to do so.

MALE (aside, to Female): He knows Compassion, even disguised as an injured man. His spirit is willing.
FEMALE (aside, to Male): Even those with a willing spirit can refuse those in need.

MALE &amp; FEMALE: We will continue our journey.
 
They walk to the center of the stage where the Beggar, Starving Man, and Injured Man now stand.

MALE: What say you three? What is the nature of this man's soul?

BEGGAR: I am Charity. I know the mind of one who gives freely. This man was willing to give me his last coin. His mind is righteous. His soul is pure.
STARVING MAN: I am Generosity. I know the heart of one who withholds nothing from those in need. This man was willing to give me his last scrap of bread. His heart is giving. His soul is pure.
INJURED MAN: I am Compassion. I know the spirit of one who will sacrifice for the greater good. This man was willing to stay with a stranger and care for him in his time of need. His spirit is merciful. His soul is pure.

MALE: What say you, Magran?
FEMALE: The trial is complete. The judgment has been made. The decision is final. This man has shown Charity, Generosity, and Compassion to those in need. His soul will be reborn. What say you, Eothas?
MALE: The judgment is final. The decision has been made. (He turns to the man) Be on your way. Your soul's transformation has begun. Welcome the light of the new dawn."

      <DefaultText>Rejoice, seekers. The judicious application of pain has loosened the tongue of our informant. The artifact we seek has recently been moved to Elm's Reach - it should be secured in a residence near the entrance of the settlement. The informant suggested it is likely stashed away under the floor. We have endured much in our pursuit of this hallowed relic - soon our efforts will come to fruition. The council of Archmartyrs awaits your triumphant return. Do not fail us.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I never expected to see a massacre such as this in my lifetime. I was in my study, trying to pack up important documents for the evacuation, never dreaming the Aedyrans would act so drastically. It was my wife, Ne'iloc, who first heard the cracking of the levies.  We climbed to the roof, when the water reached the top of the stairs. My three children, Nathe, Leibelsa, and Kyrre, we held.  The water reached our chests, and the only thing that kept us from getting swept away before it subsided was holding onto the chimney, that we had just repaired.  Other families were not so lucky.

When the waters finally subsided, the roads were littered with debris, mud, and rotting fish.  Half the district had been swallowed by the sea.  Bodies floated in the tide along with what was left in the homes.  We burned the citizens we found. The poor souls have nobody else to remember them by, so I'll document them here.  I'm not sure if they had loved ones who survived the flood, but it is better their names be written down rather than washed away with so much else in this horrific flood."

      <DefaultText>How fitting that we know the god of cycles, doorways, mortality, and inevitability as Berath, while the Vailians know this very same god as Cirono. For if nothing else, Berath teaches us that duality exists in all things. There is Life in Death, and Death in Life - embrace this duality and you honor Berath.

In the ruins Eir Glanfath, Berath is depicted in the form of two semi-skeletal figures - one male, one female - Bewnen i Ankew and Ankew i Bewnen - literally, Life in Death and Death in Life in the Glanfathan tongue. Male and female, inside and outside, life and death - we often think of Berath by imagining two sides of coin, or the two end points of a journey.

It said that Berath has the most petitioners of every god, and this likely true - who amongst us has not prayed for the cycle to hiccup? Who has not, in a moment of sadness, yelled at Berath to make an exception for our fallen loved ones?

Berath may not rescue our loved ones but it answers our prayers in its own, divine way. Berath is the god that makes life end in death, and it is also the god that makes death end in life. Berath, Cirono, Bewnen I Ankew, Ankew I Bewnen - whichever of the many names you prefer to use - deserves our prayers, for it has given us the promise of life's eternal renewal.

      <DefaultText>Sing, oh ocean waves, of Ondra's sorrow - of her unrequited love for the unattainable moon! Sing of the ocean's sorrow, so that we may forget our own! Each day, the tides reenact Ondra's longing for the great moon - the waters reach out at high tide, yearning for the heavenly body, only to slump into low tide when the moon proves unattainable.

You asked me once why I loved Ondra so dearly - how I could go from a life on dry land to being a devotee to the Goddess of the Oceans. I sing of the ocean's sorrow so that I may forget my own. It is Ondra's message that speaks to my heart - I have devoted my life to helping others discard painful memories, for that is the gift Ondra gave me. When I lost my young daughter, my wife and I were inconsolable until a Giftbearer offered to take my toddler's toys and cast them into the deepest waters. 

Truth be told, I and the other Giftbearers I know have never even spoken to Ondra... she is largely silent and when she does 'speak' she uses floods and tidal waves instead of words. But we sing of the ocean's sorrow so that others may forget theirs. Ondra's story - the story of desire unanswered - actually matters to people like you and me. Magran cannot steer you to victory over sadness, Hylea cannot force joy down a crying throat... only Ondra can give us the strength to persevere when life seems without worth. And that is the answer to your question regarding why I love my Goddess so dearly.

      <ID>1715</ID>
      <DefaultText>Young students are often confused by Berath and Rymrgand's seemingly overlapping roles in holding dominion over death. Berath oversees the cycle of life, death, and rebirth; Rymrgand oversees the cold, destructive act of death itself - this difference is often difficult for novices to appreciate until they've lost a loved one and endured the absence for a time - it is Berath that determines we will be reborn just as certainly as we will die, but Rymrgand is the executioner's axe - Rymrgand shows us that all life ends in stillness.

I need only show them the symbol of Rymrgand - the bone-white aurochs skull found carved within the most ancient of Engwithan ruins... it is a symbol of death and doom in every culture - any child with four winters under his belt needs no introduction to the ancient symbol.

Rymrgand embodies not just death, but all manifestations of collapse - be they famine, plague, or simple bad luck. Rymrgand is a primal god, silent and inscrutable as death itself. He makes himself known with his passing, not by proclamation. There are innumerable stories of the god's terrifying passage through the lands of Eora. When the Beast of Winter stirs, bitter winds and beastly howling follow the creature's every move. Wherever the beast plants a hoof, all life withers into dust. The faithful of Rymrgand insist that even another god's life can end in stillness, they claim the other gods must flee from the Beast of Winter's mastery over death - but we know not if this boast holds true.

Though the Beast of Winter is shrouded in snowy clouds, those who have seen the shaggy white monster claim that the souls of the fallen can be seen clinging (or perhaps frozen) to the beast's fur. The dwarves of the boreal south have numerous stories that tell a similar plot: a brash hero seeks out the Beast of Winter to rescue the souls trapped in its fur... these tales never end well, for even if the hero saves his beloved's soul, the hero dies in the process - for it is not a proper tale of Rymrgand unless the hero's life ends in stillness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Dear Sisters,

Do you still remember your first deliverance? When you strangled your first wrongdoer, did you see the moment when life became death? Could you see the instance when your victim realized that Woedica forgets nothing? When Woedica takes back her throne will you face her with pride, knowing you have held to your own oaths, or will you be amongst the word-breakers?

Woedica teaches vengeance and memory - and while she is in Exile, we must be her eyes and ears that let no injustice slip from record, we must be clenched fist that silences the lying breath. When Woedica takes back her throne, all of the injustices that have slipped through the cracks of history will be righted. The villains hiding in plain sight amongst the innocent will feel the Burned Queen's choking grasp - pray that you live to see the day when you will join our Queen in this cleansing of the wicked.

But know, my sisters, that we must be ready to see the end of our days without the return of our Queen - for she will take back her throne, but it may be our daughters that serve the restored court. We must continue to live as we have always lived - hated by the other faiths, even though we place justice above our own wellbeing. At least the Empire of Aedyr still holds our creed in proper esteem. It is a proper sign of respect that, by imperial custom, our clergy must oversee a contract for it to be legally binding. For who else understands the value of remembering one oaths than Woedica's faithful? And let us not count our current blessings - for we still enjoy the support of the paladin order of The Steel Garrote - they too understand that society is built and broken by the oaths and rules of its people.

When Woedica takes back her throne, my family will know that I was right to commit my life to the Exiled Queen. When Woedica takes back her throne, the Strangler will stop being a story told to frighten our daughters, but a hero woven into parables that teach our children justice. When Woedica takes back her throne, she will bring her flawless memory with her - every transgression, every crime, and every injustice will be revealed. When Woedica takes back her throne, even gods won't be spared their due retribution.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>1719</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ten years I tilled the vorlas leaf, and ten years I told myself that living in St. Waidwen's footsteps would bring me rebirth. Each dawn I'd pray that if thou art in darkness, he shall bring thee light, and each yet each night would bring the same emptiness. For my decade of living as a simple dye farmer, all I have to show for it is a great deal of purple clothing.

Eothas has not spoken to us since he appeared as St. Waidwen. It was my hope that Eothas would claim me as his next vessel but alas... the Child of Light remains silent. Every day I practice the ritual of banishing the shadows of the unfaithful... and every day I work my fields in solitude, without sign of Eothas returning. If thou art in darkness, he shall bring thee light, but how long must I remain lost in this long night of abandonment?

Is this my punishment for keeping my faith a secret? Is Eothas hiding from me until I shout my reverence for all to hear? Surely, He must know that the Dyrwoodans now hate Him and His followers... my countrymen are quick to blame all that was terrible about the Saint's War on those of us still faithful to Eothas. Should they not be angry at the Readceras soldiers? Do the Dyrwoodans not realize that to dismiss the god of rebirth and redemption is to prevent all hope of healing?

As I pen these words, I know that I must continue to till the dye-leaf. I will awake each day with hope: if thou art in darkness, he shall bring me light. Each day I will pray that the Dawnstars visit me, just as they visited St. Waidwen in his field of vorlas. Will they come to me as they came to St. Waidwen? As a man and two women, luminescent and perfect? I am told they come to presage new times... I am told many things, and I struggle to find the faith to believe it all.

And yet, each morning, the sun rises in the eastern sky - and each morning Eothas illuminates my simple plot of land, casting away the shadows of the unfaithful in His golden gaze. I thank thee, Eothas for all the springs I've had, and all that will come. I am in darkness, please bring me light.

      <DefaultText>When my students ask to be taught the way of Galawain, I tell them they have already failed. Does one ask a deer to present itself as dinner? Of course not - one must outwit, outmaneuver, and overpower the deer if one dreams of venison. So it is with the Seeker God - to ask a question is weakness and idle indecision, to seek answers is to understand, and to become one with Galawain. Survival begins with strength from within.

But I only strike my students when they ask the second stupid question, for all of us begin young and weak - it is a point fact, and not one of shame, and a central tenant to Galawain's teachings. Perseverance and cleverness are prized by Galawain above brute force - a fact my young pups often forget. It is right and proper that the strong lead the weak, and it is equally proper that the strong be continually tested until the balance changes. Galawain celebrates the strength of the victor and the prowess of the well-fed predator, but above all, the Clever Hound celebrates the transformative nature of strength. Galawain's greatest desire for us is that prey becomes predator, mewling babes grow into strong hunters, and the lost find their own enlightenment.

This philosophy is best exemplified by the rites of the anamfatha of Eir Glanfath. When one of the Glanfathan spiritual leaders is old and nearing death, it is customary to enter the woods and confront Galawain's herald. If the Seeker God finds that anamfath's life, deeds, and soul worthy, the reward is a quick death and his soul joins Galawain's pack. If deemed unworthy, the anamfath is killed, his soul forced to find its own way to the next life, and his memory erased from the records of the tribe - survival begins with strength from within, and weak leaders endanger the whole pack. This is Galawain at his purest: even at the end of life, one must struggle for worthiness, for greatness... just as one must struggle every day to feed his pack.

The Seeker God is easy to understand if one actively engages in the quest for knowledge, but his secrets are self-occluding to those who merely ask, desiring knowledge without the requisite hunt. My own flesh and blood once asked me, "Will learning to hunt please Galawain?" I told him yes but added, "Galawain would prefer that you hunt to learn."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Choice is a luxury we earn through peace. Struggle is our fundamental nature.

Even when our war banners sit idle, mankind foments strife - friends argue with fists, lovers kindle jealousies, merchants compete with lies... wherever mankind goes, struggle follows.

Magran is Goddess of fire and war, not bloodshed and conquest - though many in Readceras would tell it differently - how bitter they must be that Magran's priests were able to destroy a god made manifest... how bitter indeed. We who worship Magran are not addled barbarians or cloistered mystics. We are soldiers, armorers, watchmen, and bodyguards - artisans of conflict and protectors of our families and flags. We do not salivate for battle, we view war as unwelcome, but struggle is our fundamental nature. We do not pray for strife, we pray for the wisdom to resolve it quickly. We do not wish for war, but when it inevitably must be fought, we find divine ecstasy in discipline, efficiency, and excellence.

Magran, guide us to the battle that is just and fair - let us be your fire that burns away the profane, leaving only the righteous. If struggle is our fundamental nature, let victory be our inevitable state of grace!</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>My mother lived every note of life's song - bringing me into this world was her last verse. For this, my father scorned me and abandoned me, and for this very same fact, my town's midwife and adherent of Hylea raised me as her own. When I came of age, I learned that Hylea visits us on the screams of women in childbirth - and when a woman dies giving life to her child, her soul is carried away and reborn as an avian attendant of Hylea's Court. Through the miracle of the Queen of Birds, my mother has been with me, watching over me my whole life.

I wear the fetish charms of the Cloudsinger - the bird I dreamt my mother became. My feathery trinkets look gaudy and unbecoming, but it is a signal fire to women in need that I am a trained midwife, blessed by Hylea and living every note of life's song. The Queen of Birds wills us to shepherd new life into the world, and not, as the other gods so often desire, to end it.

A follower of Magran once mocked my faith, saying I worshiped paintbrushes and birds - piddling things beneath the gods. I do not resent the other gods and the brutal necessities that they must oversee - but is not language, love, the arts, and creativity that which separates us from simple beasts? Hylea allows us to rise above our savage, feral selves. 

I am often amused that, upon seeing our holy aviaries, visitors frequently ask, "This is nice, but where is the REAL temple of Hylea?" Perhaps they think hallowed ground requires oppressive stoneworks and ceilings that hide the sky. They do not realize the Bird Queen stands not on ceremony, she makes herself manifest in the music of birds and in beauty of the ubiquitous open sky. 

Hylea prefers the worship of two children singing over a thousand petitioners silently praying for victory. The Sky-mother asks so little of us, and yet so much - we are charged to live every note of life's song... it surprises me how many fail to embrace this divine calling.

      <DefaultText>My Son,
Tomorrow I become The Effigy, tomorrow I become Skaen's embodiment on Eora, tomorrow my master chokes on his own whip.

For months, we met by secret conclave to plot our landlord's demise, all the while working the fields as if our hearts were content. Skaen teaches us to plot with the mind while keeping one's face impassive, inscrutable - fair fights are for those with armies. The Quiet Slave is our whetstone, our focus - in his worship, our cause finds focus, clarity, and possibility! Tomorrow, my master chokes on his own whip.

By the time you read this, I will be dead. I pray Skaen does not abandon me for speaking of my plotting, but a son deserves to know how his father died. For I have volunteered to be the Effigy - Skaen will inhabit my body, using this old farmer's simple flesh as a puppet of godly rage. I have been shaved and anointed - tomorrow morning, I will be your father in name only, as my manhood will be removed, my nose and ears removed, and my useless mortal eyes will be replaced with flint stones through which Skaen might see the world.

My son, I am sorry for the lies I have told you these past few seasons, but Skaen demands secrecy - even your mother knows nothing of my furtive service to The Quiet Slave. Curse my name if you must, but never weep for me, for I die for the betterment of our community, to smite our lord's corruption from the face of Eora! Tomorrow my master chokes on his own whip, for tomorrow, I become the Effigy!</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Dearest brother, or was it sister?

May this letter find you in well spirits. A man of thuggish bearing stormed into my library the other day and demanded I help him find a book on the construction of an arquebus.

 I thought it proper service to Wael to steer this man toward an illuminated manuscript on the subject of whittling toy soldiers and other miniature props. Unamused by my solution, I shrugged and said, "What is an answer without a question?" He did not find my spiritual rhetoric helpful or amusing, and so he punched out two of my teeth. I trust your summer has been less tumultuous than mine?

In more important news, my apprentice claims she saw the Eyeless Face in a dream the other night! I admit, I was so mad with envy that at first I refused to believe her... Wael forgive me for such a lapse of judgment.

She described an aumaua of brilliant blue hues with a featureless face surrounded by a swarm of eyes - no two eyes alike. She claims Wael ignored her questions, and she can't recall any specifics of what was said. In fact, my apprentice seems to have forgotten many things since before the visitation - she could not tell me where she grew up or what she liked to eat.

At first I was so envious of her for having seen Wael with her own eyes... but it seems Wael's visit was to conceal, not to illuminate... I pray she endures this test of faith and can look back at the event and feel the joy of mystery.

What is an answer without a question? Last week, I felt the solution was "ignorance," but after Wael's visit, I feel "a road without length" is closer to the capturing the riddle.

I worry my apprentice will look back at her visit from Wael and feel cheated - robbed of some moment of clarity we all thought we were owed when we first joined... I tried to tell her she was lucky but she was too young to understand. What is an answer without a question? May I be dead and my soul scattered to the winds before anyone knows for certain.

      <DefaultText>Your soldiers are not fully armed, or even decently dressed, without some basic knowledge of the Glanfathan language. If your scouts cannot eavesdrop, if our captured soldiers cannot recognize the words of their captors, or if our officers cannot answer a call to parlay - we fail. Knowing just a few simple facepainter words could mean the difference between tactical success and defeat in detail.

Glanfathan writing is, like Aedyran, adapted from the Old Vailian alphabet brought overseas by the Aedyrans long ago. The Glanfathans put their own spin on this alphabet, so there are some noticeable differences that can confuse the uninformed.

A and â is the difference between "paw" and "pat."
E and ê is the difference between "hen" and "hay."
I and î is the difference between "ilk" and "eel."
O and ô is the difference between "oats" and "ought."
W and ŵ is the difference between "butt" and "boot."

Note that last part - in Eir Glanfath, the letter w acts as our letter u - speaking with a consonant "www" sound is the perfect way to alert a Glanfathan to the fact that you're a Dyrwoodan struggling to learn the language. See "estramor" in the glossary below.

And keep in mind these tricky differences:

Dh is used for a hard thorn sound, such as with "this" or "that." Conversely, Th is a softer sound in Glanfathan - barely vocalized, like when one says "thief" or "thought."
Si sounds like a soft sh sound - like "ship." Put an accent on it and Sî sounds like "she" - you add an "h" sound in either case.

There's no replacement for actually learning Glanfathan by immersion, but to get you started, here are some important words that you and your soldiers should know:

Anam - soul
Anamfath, plural anamfatha - the spiritual leaders of the tribes.
Argŵes - armor (pronounced "Arg-oo-es")
Bewnen - life (pronounced "Be-uh-nen")
Blaidh - wolf (pronounced "Blay-th")
Cas - battle
Delem - leaf
Den - man
Enfath - princess
Estramor, plural Estramorwn - foreigner(s) (plural is "Es-tra-mor-un")
Fath, plural Fatha - prince(s)
Gwan - winter
Henwn - woman
I - in
Lle - place
Pames - walker
Rhemen - building
Rî, plural rîow - wise one(s) (singular is pronounced "Ree," plural is "Ree-au")
Scâth - shield
ŵen - maiden (pronounced "oo-en")
Weredh - soil (pronounced "ue-reth" with a hard th sound)
Weretha - the whole of our world (pronounced "ue-retha" with a soft th sound)</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sun does not set on the Aedyran language. Those of us who commune with this proud language, or some derivation of it, populate every corner of Eora.

Most of us who speak this wonderful tongue know it as Aedyran, but scholars and those obsessed with correctness often qualify it as 'modern' or 'contemporary' Aedyran. This is to contrast the language you and I speak today with Eld Aedyran - the old elven language that was spoken in the Aedyran Empire back before the pioneer settlers of the Dyrwood built their longships.

If Eld Aedyran could be considered the mother of the living Aedyran, the language of Hylspeak could be seen as Aedyran's cousin. Hylspeak is fading from common use but many of the elves (especially the older one) in the Aedyran heartland still use this dialect.

Whether you know it or not, if you can read these words, you can understand Hylspeak - it is almost identical to Aedyran but includes a large vocabulary of archaic words that have fallen out of use in today's Aedyran. When you hear bards sing old Aedyran poems, there are often lines of chorus that sound like melodic nonsense inserted to complete rhymes - these are usually instances of words that are lost from our common language but still used in Hylspeak.

While Hylspeak is familiar to speakers of so-called 'modern' Aedyran, the same cannot be said of our language's predecessor. Eld Aedyran is a dead language, spoken by academics but not used in any major community. Eld Aedyran words are often familiar to Aedyran readers, but the words use orthography that has since been abandoned - unfamiliar accents marks abound.

For example, Eld Aedyran contains some diphthongs that have no place in the modern Aedyran, as well as a few tricky consonant clusters:

Ea creates an "ey-ah" sound that sounds like the colloquial salutation "heya!"
Eo sounds like "ey-oh" - this sound is still used in the modern word "Eora."
Ey is pronounced as "ey-ee" such as in "wraith."
Ue and ü both create long "oo" sounds, as in "loop."
Y sounds like a "ee" sounds as in "bee."
Gj sounds like the consonant "y" as in "you."
Sc sounds like sh, so you'd pronounce scop like "shop."
Cg sounds like the "dge" end of a word like "hedge."

It is not uncommon for given names of Aedyrans, Dyrwoodans, and Readcerans to come from Eld Aedyran. Some examples:

Aldwyn is pronounced "ALD-ween" because of the long vowel sound on the y.
Durnisc is pronounced "DUR-nish" since the final Sc cluster sounds like an Sh sound.
Gjestr is pronounced "YES-tr" on account of the Gj consonant cluster.
Slecg is pronounced like "Sledge."
Thyrsc is pronounced "THEER-sh."
Uscgrim is "OOSH-grim" and not "usk-grim"
Yngmar is pronounced "EENG-mar," leading with a vowel sound.</DefaultText>

'I can't believe my luck. A few rounds of dice, and I've got my hands on a genuine Engwithan artifact. Fellow who had it said it was a pretty nothing, as far as he's concerned - he's not willing to go digging in some ruins. But if he's right about this gem leading to a hidden treasure, then that's worth sneaking past a few painted elves.

I'll head to Cilant Lîs in the morning. Then it's just a matter of finding this relief he was talking about.'</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Its blade covered with graceful Glanfathan engravings, Whispers of Yenwood was once the sword of the first Roadwarden of Caed Nua.

When the Erl of Yenwood appointed Cafed Eodhart, the young lord feared the spirits that were rumored to dwell under the young castle's foundation. He spent a sizable sum to have the black Ymyran steel blade forged, shipped to the Eastern Reach for engraving by the erl's Glanfathan slave artisans, and enchanted in New Dunryd.

Cafed is known to have used the sword in the Battle of Old Geiran and to help the neighboring Raedrics suppress an uprising in Gilded Vale, but there is no recorded use of it in Caed Nua.

Over time, Cafed began to believe that the sword had been cursed by the Glanfathan artisans who decorated it. He confided in those close to him that he thought the spirits of the dead were speaking to him through the blade while he slept.

One evening, against the pleas of his wife and soldiers, a maddened Cafed carried the sword deep into the misty woods of Eir Glanfath. His body was never recovered, but the next Roadwarden the erl assigned to Caed Nua found it waiting for him on the throne in the keep's great hall. None of the soldiers could explain how the sword had appeared there. No Roadwarden has carried the sword since that day.</DefaultText>

      <ID>1876</ID>
      <DefaultText>The famed White Forge of Durgan's Battery produced some of the greatest weapons and pieces of armor known in the Eastern Reach. The White Forge's dwarven smiths carefully guarded the secret techniques they used to craft Durgan Steel, legendary for its strength, flexibility, and ability to hold sharp edge. When Durgan's Battery was overrun by an unknown force, the fires of the White Forge went dark and the secrets of Durgan Steel died with its smiths.

The owner of this sword was an orlan from Twin Elms who claimed he found the naked blade near the skeleton of a dwarf in the foothills near Stalwart. Many were skeptical of his claims that it was a Durgan Steel blade, but it bore the maker's mark of the White Forge. The orlan had artisans from the Fisher Crane tribe create a guard, grip, and pommel to dress the blade, resulting in its unusual appearance.

The proud owner's luck did not last long. He went missing somewhere near Elmshore shortly after receiving his finished sword. Many locals believed that he had been killed for his prize, but neither he nor his weapon were ever seen again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This finely-crafted but unassuming rapier was created in the hot and humid forests of the Cythwood. Its first owner was a minor nobleman named Aedwyn Grundmef. Known in social circles for his obsequious manner and annoying habit of lingering too long where he was not wanted, Aedwyn had little use for the blade in the courts he frequented.

When Aedwyn died an unnotable death, the blade passed to a young niece, Cadend Grundmef. She found that the weapon had characteristics of her uncle: good at interrupting at inopportune times, draining the life out of anyone it came into contact with, and a generally annoying presence. It was Cadend who gave the rapier its nickname, "Mosquito," and used it regularly in court duels.

The weapon passed to Aedwyn's grandson in the Dyrwood upon her death. A thayn of Cwynsrun, he was lost during a Glanfathan raid. Mosquito was lost with him. As he had no descendants and none of the Grundmeths of Aedyr have made a claim on the rapier, it has circulated among anonymous Glanfathan and Dyrwoodan owners ever since.</DefaultText>

"And if he's right, we've got to hope that the 'cantec' he speaks of was written down somewhere. We've decided to strike camp and search the area for books, records, something. Anything's better than sitting in the middle of this blizzard."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Day 4 - Took down another stag today. Still not enough hides to make this trip worth it.

Day 6 - Blizzard coming. Staying put until it passes.

Day 9 - Close call with a pair of ogres. Lucky they didn't see us. 

Day 11 - Tracking a large bear that Nurin spotted from the ridge. Might even be Greyjaw. My grandfather told stories about him. Wouldn't that be something if we were the ones to finally kill him?

Day 12 - It's definitely Greyjaw. We're dangerously close to the ogre cavern, but we've got Greyjaw trapped and his hide is too valuable to pass up. The three of us should be able to handle one bear.

      <DefaultText>"Esteemed Coinmaster Zoltun,

I write to you in anger and bafflement. Have I not been a faithful customer to you? Have I not been fair in my dealings? Yet after all of our business together, your people turn me away like some filthy beggar.

I arrived at the Battery a fortnight ago, frost in my beard and not a morsel in my belly. Barely had I unhitched the horses when your Komendant Exandru came to meet me. The priest told me that I would be made welcome but my 'profane' business would not. In short, I would have to leave at first light, my wagons empty.

Certain that this was but a negotiating tactic, I told Exandru that I would of course see him compensated along with you. He left in a huff, and when I presented myself at the door, it was Komendant Marunn - your armswarden! - who met me. She told me to leave at once, that she wouldn't have my 'coin-grubbing' hands tarnishing Durgan steel.

Now, I appreciate forceful bargaining as much as any man of coin, but I was cold, hungry, and put off by her vehemence. So, I showed her the letter you had sent inviting me to examine your latest stock of Durgan steel.

Komendant Marunn drove a rapier through the letter and sliced it in two! She then warned me that her blade - a fine weapon, indeed - would be the last I ever laid eyes on if I did not hie back down the mountain at once.

Never have I endured such humiliation and expense only to return home empty-handed! I do not understand what has passed between you and your associates, but I urge you to take charge. I fear the other komendants will be your undoing - indeed, that of all Durgan's Battery - if you do not deal with them swiftly and decisively.

Yours,
Mestre Anetto of Cezarro"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though its maker's mark can be traced to an otherwise unremarkable smithy in Dawning, this shield earned its fame within the keeping of Poldur Grynt, a young Aedyran lord whose fondness for dueling became the inspiration for many anti-Aedyr folksongs and plays in the time during and after the War of Defiance. 

Grynt cultivated a reputation as a relentless and unbeatable foe, for whenever a duel seemed to be going poorly he would raise his black shield and resume the fight with renewed vigor. Grynt employed the shield to great effect for several years, until he finally found himself severely outmatched by a more experienced rival. Mistakenly believing that the shield could preserve him even at the precipice of death, Grynt fled the field, only to bleed out on the bank of the Isce Îen River. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This heater shield bears the black wolf of the Badgradr line, as well as the personal sigil of the shield's last bearer, Mecgrun Badgradr.

A renowned fighter, Mecgrun had a reputation for practicality and ingenuity, and in his hands his shield was as much a weapon as his blade. Mecgrun had a particular fondness for taking on spellcasters, for his shield could reflect his foes' own arrows or spells against them, and a blow to the face from the Barricade was usually enough to put an end to further casting.

While their Ungradr cousins went on to rule the Coldwater region, the Badgradrs did not survive the War of Defiance. Mecgrun himself perished in the Battle of Defiance Bay, and his shield passed into the hands of a series of noble masters before slipping from common recollection. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A famed dwarven explorer, Katrenn exemplified her people's reputation for wanderlust, undertaking journeys spanning nations on both sides of the Great Eastern Ocean. To aid her in her expeditions, she commissioned a set of hide armor which would allow her to cross treacherous terrain without hindrance. Inspired by her stories, the armorer enchanted the hide to grant the wearer uncommon stamina. The sight of Katrenn running along unscathed through a field of thorny brambles became a common one. 

It is said that Katrenn's fame and experience was such that she was asked to accompany the expedition which would ultimately result in the founding of Durgan's Battery. Whatever the truth of the matter, no further records of her exploits exist.</DefaultText>

He imbued the Golden Scales with protective enchantments against flame, as well as the same reflective properties which protected its namesake against ranged opponents. The result was an eye-catching and effective piece of armor, and it proved especially popular amongst those intent on being the center of attention.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ydwen was a paladin and member of the Kind Wayfarers during the War of Black Trees. She was famous for escorting colonists and farmers through the Dyrwood and protecting them from Glanfathan war bands. Though a skilled warrior, she avoided the Glanfathans when possible rather than fight them. However, tensions and tempers rose, and one day she found herself guiding a family of farmers from their ruined homestead. While she attempted to wait out the prowling raiders, one of her charges rushed into the fray. Ydwen was forced to hold off the Glanfathans while the rest of the farmers fled. She died, outnumbered and surrounded, and it was said that even the raider who struck the killing blow wept for her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This gray cloak is covered in a multitude of stylized eyes, symbols of the god Wael. It is said to have been created by the wizard Göryn, who hoped that the pious endeavor might invoke Wael's protection. Set against the many eyes of the Hundred Mysteries, Göryn hoped, his enemies would stumble after falsehoods, while he would remain resistant to the bewildering effects of the world's mysteries. 

Those who have come across the cloak since have found much use in its enchantments. What became of Göryn himself is unknown, however, for nothing else remains of the man or his works.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sword passed to a warrior of the Twice-Split Arrows in honor of his bravery and skill during a ritual blood-hunt. This was a moment of great pride for the tribe, typically regarded as least among the six. It was also a time of shifting borders and changing relations between Dyrwood and Eir Glanfath. Bolstered by the newfound prestige and eager to seize more, the rîow of the Twice-Split Arrows declared that their young hunter should lead a series of raids on slave-holding estates. The first few were successful, but when the raiders set their sights on a village run by a guild of coopers, they were quickly overwhelmed. The hunter was killed and his sword lost.</DefaultText>

Whether for aesthetic or functional reasons, Galvino fitted the face with onyx eyes. Their smooth finish reflects the Devil's surroundings impassively, though occasionally a glint of imperfections within the stone or some deep-seated spark of malevolence shines through.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>According to legend, this shield was one of twelve fashioned for a small subset of paladins from the Order of Kind Wayfarers. Calling themselves the Towers, the paladins charged themselves with protecting the small outlying villages and towns clustered along the foothills of the White March.  

Though their numbers were few, the paladins were known for their unwavering dedication, moving swiftly to engage any threat to innocent travelers. Those with the fortune to fight beside these warriors often said that they felt as if otherwise fatal blows would glance harmlessly off their armor, and claimed that the paladins had brought them fortune.

As the years passed, each of the paladins succumbed to age or violence, until only one remained. The last Tower became a legendary figure in her own right, walking a lonely patrol along the eastern roads of the Dyrwood.

This shield is said to have been pulled from the Lake of Drowned Tombs by a villager from Goodhope. The battered kite shield remains a fine piece of craftsmanship, though the green paint of its heraldic tower has been scraped away in several places. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Commander Baelorin, 

Proceed to Crägholdt with utmost haste. Concelhaut will not willingly part with the Engwithan Phylactery, but you must secure it by any means necessary. Be warned that all previous attempts at acquiring the artifact have met with abject failure. We know very little about the phylactery, save that it is nearly indestructible. With that in mind, I would recommend using your considerable forces to lay siege to Crägholdt. Once Concelhaut is dead, you may retrieve the phylactery from what remains of his tower. Delivery of the artifact is your primary charge, but definitive proof of Concelhaut's demise shall entitle you to a substantial bonus. 

Spare no expense in fulfilling this task, but know that any outside interference will constitute a breach of this agreement. I have spent considerable resources to ensure that any local authorities will look the other way. Any overly-curious parties should be dealt with accordingly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It was in the time of Edrahil the Sure-Footed that we came to Clîaban Rilag, an ancient place of the 'Builders,' as the locals call them. It was a marvelous sight, a door in the mountain framed by a pair of ghoulish aspects. Through some exercise of trickery or cunning, Edrahil was able to gain access for our scholars that we might observe and record what lay inside.

We discovered a foundry of sorts, the like of which neither we nor our distant brethren had seen. Through careful observation, we surmised that the ancients had used this place to extract souls and transfer them to suits of armor - delicate and challenging work, yet the scale they had achieved left us humbled and astounded. 

Perhaps most remarkable were the 'golems' - living suits of armor powered by essence! We lost two of our fellows when the creatures caught us unawares, but once we'd subdued them, they proved quite fascinating.

All too aware that our hosts would never again allow us - nor other curious travelers - to visit this place, we took meticulous notes and measurements of all we saw, forsaking bread and sleep until the work was done.

We reported all to Edrahil, whereupon he praised our work and urged us quickly forward. For if such a place lay abandoned in the forest, who can say what other mysteries gods and kith have left in this strange and wild land?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"For every work there is a practice. Arm yourself with skill and temper your labors with patience.

Strike only when your medium is ready. Do not cold work plate.

Brittle steel is worse than a treacherous friend. Temper your work lest it shatter like glass.

Fools praise appearance, but the master praises strength. 

True virtue lies in work well done. Pattern-welded steel shall be folded no fewer than seven times.

The finest smith cannot shape poor metals. Set your hand to steels that have been properly treated with charcoal.

Like a room full of discord is a forge with uneven heat. Do not let it pervert your metal.

As the blows of the hammer speak to the steel, so the color of the steel speaks to the smith. 

Like a babe is heated steel, fragile and easily corrupted. Handle it gently, lest your haste twist and warp it.

Do not neglect work that lies hidden and unseen, for a shoddy tang can break the blade.

The wise smith works carefully and anneals but once. The careless smith weeps to find flaws after the steel has been hardened and tempered.

As a blade drawn in multiple heats is work done in its proper time."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The margins of this text are scribbled with notes and references. The ink-stained pages appear to have seen much use in earlier times.

"The removal and transference of souls is a practice both ancient and sophisticated. There is evidence that the Engwithans were particularly adept at this, yet few details have survived them."

Someone scrawled "Annals of the Pargrunen, pp. 382-6" below this paragraph.

"What is known is that the removal of a soul is a difficult process, and one that requires an expert hand and precise tools for any chance of success. Early attempts on a test pool of one hundred thirty-eight goats left most of the subjects with maimed or fractured souls. In all but two of the eleven instances where the soul was successfully removed, the essence dissipated before scholars could capture it."

The words "transfer to holding vessel" are written and underlined in the margin.

"The process requires conductive materials - copper and adra, specifically. Immersion in water is important to ensure that the soul is drawn in a steady and uniform manner, with no distortions or breakages. A warped soul is, at best, useless, and at worst, unpredictable."

An arrow points from this paragraph to a scrunched note: "Extraction pool in C.R.: 18 ft. wide by 3 ft. deep."

"We have since mastered the process of soul transference and have seen the benefits of infusing forged work with the essence of animals and wilder. What remains to be seen is whether we might see greater gains from using the souls of kith, where we would procure the appropriate subjects, and how much personality and autonomy we would want to leave intact in such cases."

A string of notes winds around and below this paragraph, beginning with "criminals, prisoners of war, volunteers?" and ending with "Forge Guardians" in block letters.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Adventurers from all over Eora go to the Living Lands in search of fame and fortune. Antonino went to rob them.

He had earned a reputation as a cunning thief in Biageppe, but a reputation is the last thing a cunning thief needs. So he left Biageppe and, indeed, the Vailian Republics for fresh opportunities in the Living Lands, taking with him little more than his coin purse and a fresh change of smallclothes.

Unfortunately, Antonino soon learned that the hardened treasure-hunters of the Living Lands were little like the plump merchants of the Republics. Within a few weeks, he'd exhausted his meager supplies and had earned nothing for his suffering. Desperate, he stumbled across a rough-looking pair from the Deadfire Archipelago and begged to share their fire. They agreed too easily.

When the bandits made their move, Antonino was ready. He snatched the pistol from one and fired on the other. With the first attacker advancing, he pulled the trigger again only to hear a dull thud. While his assailant laughed, Antonino pulled back and struck the man's bald head with the pistol. The bandit collapsed, dead instantly.

Antonino eventually became a successful and feared robber and the subject of many campfire tales. Even as his fortunes increased, he kept the stolen pistol, a sturdy piece of case-hardened metal that served him throughout his career.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The elven kingdom of Kulklin warred with the Aedyr Kingdom for nearly two centuries before the two powers merged. During that time, many of the fiercest conflicts flared up along the edge of the Cythwood, where the two powers shared a border.

The Cythwood elves used the jungle terrain to their advantage and quickly became infamous for their cunning and brutal tactics. Skirmishers would fell trees behind invading Aedyran forces while druids made more to grow in their path, confusing and stalling their foes. They would often pair these maneuvers with devastating, lightning-fast attacks, surrounding lost platoons and dragging stragglers into the forest. Most notoriously, they would hang their victims from the trees to warn off further attacks.

The Kulklin of the Cythwood were swift and improvised attacks quickly, owing in part to their use of everyday tools - axes, knives, and bows - as weapons of war. Axes such as Wodewys would have been used against folk and tree alike.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This sabre belonged to the first mate of the Hangman's Bounty, a notorious pirate ship that roamed the Deadfire Archipelago three centuries ago. Legend has it that the crew seized a slave galley and, after killing the masters, decided to sell the slaves at the next port. One of the slaves, an elderly man with a scarred face and beady black eyes, came forward and demanded that he and his fellows be set free.

The pirates laughed and refused him, but the old slave persisted. He warned them of the terrible plagues and punishments awaiting them, yet still they refused. When he raised his voice in anger, the first mate drew her sabre and ran him through. Putrid green bile poured from the wound, running upward along the sword while the sailors watched in horror. The corruption spread from the dying slave's chest to the first mate's sabre and arm, filling her veins with venom and her flesh with squirming maggots.

The rest of the crew drove the ship aground fled, leaving the slaves to flee and the first mate to rot next to her tainted blade.</DefaultText>

He hired a Vailian wizard to assist in his children's training, and this wizard crafted a rod specifically for that purpose. He promised that the rod's missiles were mild enough to avoid seriously injuring the thayn's heirs but that the weapon would, in time, reveal the nature of their weakness.

The rod performed exactly as the wizard had promised. Yet after months of training, Baldwen's children were no better in combat, but half of Ashfall knew of their weak parries and blind spots. When both heirs fell to a Glanfathan raid, the wizard fled, taking Golden Gaze with him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Curoc was an Aedyran noble in Readceras who owned six hundred acres of vorlas fields. He considered himself a pious man, and his neighbors and tenant farmers knew him for his fervent devotion to Woedica. He labored alongside his tenants and kept meticulous records of production and sales. Yet he was also known for his pitiless temper and his ruthlessness with shirkers. He carried a switch with him and would savagely thrash any worker he caught dawdling or lagging.

Yet he was a favorite of the imperial governor, and so his excesses went overlooked.

One day, Waidwen approached him while he was doling out an especially savage beating. Waidwen, fresh from his encounter with Eothas, demanded that Curoc release his victim. When the lord refused, Waidwen asked what the tenant farmer had done to deserve such treatment.

"He neglects his duties in the field," Curoc replied. "Every day, he gathers less, yet still he enjoys the protection of my estate."

"Is it any wonder that your harsh treatment of the man would render him unable to fulfill his duties? Let him enjoy a week of rest. He will return to your service renewed," said Waidwen.

Curoc sneered. "You would reward his indolence! It is my right and my responsibility to discipline him for his errors."

"What authority gave you such power over this man?" Waidwen asked.

"Woedica, the Oathbinder. It is she who set me above the farmer as his lord and employer and her order that I serve in disciplining him."

But Waidwen persisted. "Does not the quiet winter beget the fruitful spring? It is by Eothas' clemency that we enjoy rebirth in each new life and restoration with each morning. And it is Eothas' season that blesses your fields. I say to you again: release this man."

In his fury, Curoc turned on Waidwen, his switch raised to strike. Yet the rod grew suddenly hot in his hand. He cried out, and as he held the rod, it ignited. The flame that gushed forth blinded him instantly, scarring his face in the manner of the Burned Queen.

Curoc dropped the smoldering rod and fled to tell the governor of what he had witnessed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Spelltongue was first forged in Rauatai as a dueling weapon, and it has changed hands dozens of times since then. Its forked tip, undulating blade, and blue coloration made it a quick favorite among novices whose confidence often outpaced their skill.

It was most recently won by Matapa, a young woman from one of the wealthy aumaua families of Tongira. With the blade in hand, she declared to her parents that she would take Spelltongue and seek her fortune in Tâkowa as a duelist. Her parents attempted to dissuade her, but her resolve became clear, and they eventually offered their reluctant congratulations and threw a great feast in her honor.

After Matapa had drunk her fill of wine and gorged herself on buttered lobster and sea snails in cream, her mother challenged her to a duel. Matapa laughed, but her mother promised her that, if she won, she would receive half of her family's fortune the next morning. If she lost, she would surrender Spelltongue without complaint. Matapa regarded her mother, a petite woman - by aumaua standards - with little combat experience. She accepted and the duel began, Matapa brandishing Spelltongue and her mother armed with a wooden practice sword.

Matapa's mother was nimble, and Matapa's thrusts and ripostes were quick but sloppy. Her mother led her around the feast table and into the darkened courtyard, where Matapa tripped. Falling, Matapa ran Spelltongue through her mother's thigh even as the older woman held her wooden sword to the younger woman's neck. The onlookers declared the duel a tie, and Matapa received her inheritance at the cost of her prized sword. Matapa's parents quietly sold the blade to a merchant bound for Dyrwood, and Matapa, sobered by her loss, abandoned her ambitions as a duelist and instead became a successful playwright.</DefaultText>

She intended it for her game warden, who was charged with defending her forests from the spirits and wilder that roamed it. She ordered the blade forged according to her warden's specifications and sent an heirloom sword to provide the pommel.

Yet the estoc never arrived, and weeks after the promised delivery date, the aroki heard rumors of divisive Pargrunen politics and conflict within Durgan's Battery. She sent her game warden to personally retrieve the blade, but by the time he arrived, Durgan's Battery was sealed shut, with no sign of the dwarves who had recently inhabited it. The blade - and the aroki's considerable investment - were believed to be lost.</DefaultText>

Fairhope found itself besieged when the harbormaster turned away the Seafang, a notorious pirate ship. The harbormaster stationed archers on the cliffs around town, and while their arrows kept the Seafang from docking, they couldn't drive the pirate ship away. As a result, the Seafang prowled just out of range of the archers' arrows, close enough to discourage merchant and supply ships.

As the siege stretched on, the harbormaster called for more archers, promising a reward to any who could land an arrow on the Seafang. One young Glamfellen came forward, but when the harbormaster saw her hunting bow, he laughed, explaining that she'd need a top-quality longbow at the least. But she insisted, and when the harbormaster led her to the cliff, she called a storm that struck the Seafang and churned the waves around it. The harbormaster watched as the Seafang sank before his eyes. When the wreck washed ashore, the Glamfellen drew Stormcaller and plunked an arrow into the broken mast.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This sword is well-made but modest in design. The lone flourish is a feather pattern radiating from the hilt, and even this has been crafted with exquisite care - each barb and shaft is a smooth, straight line beneath your fingers. Power and warmth radiate from this blade. </DefaultText>

The pages contain an assortment of entries. Some list collections of items alongside their purported value. Other pages are scribbled with notes about the land.

Interestingly, one of these displays a map of the Russetwood where a frozen pond has been clearly marked as important.</DefaultText>

It gives me pride to see what you've suffered for your craft. The other apprentices may be more learned than you, but none match your tenacity.

For you understand something they do not.

Your body is a shell. If you are to achieve the power you desire, you will outlive it.

Your fellows fight and scheme against one another. Only you recognize your true foe."

"Folcsdag. Woke up this morning and saw my toes had turned blue. Spent the last of my fuel warming them up, but it only took me an hour to start the campfire this time. How far I've come!

I passed a village yesterday and thought about stopping. A warm bed and a proper meal would've been a treat after almost a week in these mountains! But I don't want to lose track of my soul twin, not when I'm so close.

I dreamed of the cave behind the waterfall last night. I think that's where I'll find him - I'm not sure what else it could mean. But I'd better-"

      <DefaultText>"Pelden,

You're the most talented of my apprentices. But your understanding is merely a page among the tomes of knowledge I've accumulated.

Curb your pride until you've earned it. No weakness is deadlier.

I can almost see your hands shaking and your face reddening as you read this. You think that mastering a few basic hexes makes you my worthy pupil? I'd crafted the Parasitic Staff when I was half your age. 

And while I worked, my peers plotted against me.

You may have surpassed the others for now, but they will band together against you if you give them reason. Conceal your skill with mistakes. Hide your malice behind smiles. Sacrifice your vanity for a few precious years that you might survive long enough to earn the title of 'wizard.'"

You tinker with blades and bludgeons while your peers shape the bodies and minds of kith, and they look down on you for it.

Let them.

Spellwork often attracts a certain kind of mind - one drawn to the mystery and theatre of grand, arcane spectacle.

But you are burdened with no such pretension. You see magic for what it is - power, raw and malleable. You shape it as best suits your needs, and this is what gives the greatest spells their strength. While the other apprentices are still perfecting their own ambitious spells, you will complete yours. When that day comes, strike them down, and do not hesitate."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sabra Marie was owned by an archer from the Vailian Republics who fought for Dyrwoodan independence. When the War of Defiance began, many from the newly-independent Republics took up the cause and joined the battle to the north.

The Vailian had a longer - and more melodious - name for his bow, but "Sabra Marie" quickly became the local bastardization. No recorded histories explain where he got the bow, but plenty attest to its usefulness against larger forces. Quick, powerful shots fired from cover scattered and confused many Aedyran units throughout the war.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>These boots were originally designed and made to punish runaway slaves. The lord who commissioned them would force attempted runaways to wear them for a week straight, waking and sleeping. The soles were studded with pebbles and shards that ground against the wearer's feet while the leather chafed sores into his heels. By the end of a week, most who wore the boots could barely walk.

Yet the slaves in this manor rose up and summoned the Effigy. Once the Effigy had completed his bloody work, the slaves discovered an unexpected boon - the boots that had once been a punishment had been transformed into something comfortable and, likely, valuable. 

The surviving slaves argued over the boots, and when words turned to blows, the daughter of the man who'd become the Effigy grabbed them and ran. She never looked back.</DefaultText>

"Anni Iroccio: The New Year

While only 150 years old (and of Vailian origin as well), the Iroccian calendar is currently used throughout most of the Dyrwood and the surrounding areas. While the Dyrwood was using the Aedyran calendar until recently, they gave it up in favor of the Iroccian calendar. The transition was easy to get people to make because the Aedyran calendar was hopelessly inaccurate.

Iroccio calculated that it takes the planet approximately 334 days to orbit the sun, so he took the nine months from the Aedyran calendar and broke them into sixteen months of twenty days each, with each season consisting of four months. The length of each month corresponds to how long it takes Belafa (one of our moons) to circle the planet. At the end of each season, three days - not part of either season - are set aside for people to celebrate the transitions. Lastly, the final two days of the year - New Year and Mid Year - are used to observe the beginning and midpoint of the year.

To prevent any confusion for the transition from the old calendar to the new, Iroccio kept the year the same. So, although the calendar has only been in existence for 150 years, it is currently 2823 AI (Anni Iroccio).

Iroccio gave the months Vailian names, but in the Dyrwood and surrounding areas, they call them by their translated names.

The year is broken down in the following way -

New Year - A day to celebrate the arrival of the new year. Of all the holidays, this one is celebrated by most people around the Dyrwood and the Vailian Republics. Each new year is greeted with a fervent zeal to begin things anew and start with a fresh slate.

Winter Months (Two at the beginning of the year and two at the end)

Deep Winter - Fonivèrno 
Late Winter - Tarivèrno 

Spring Dawn (3 days) - Inprima - Used to celebrate the transition of the world, rebirth, and Spring. Eothasian festivals are especially prevalent at this time, or were, prior to the Saint’s War. 
 
Spring Months

Early Spring - Préprima
Mid Spring - Majprima
Deep Spring - Fonprima
Late Spring - Tarprima

Summer Rising (3 days) - Inestu - A period of transition from birth to growth. Many ceremonies designed to usher children into adulthood take place during Summer Rising.

Summer Months (and Mid Year)

Early Summer - Préëstu
Mid Summer - Majestu

Mid Year - A day of reflection and introspection. The year is half over. People who made promises on New Year use Mid Year to assess their progress and renew their oaths.

Deep Summer - Fonestu
Late Summer - Tarestu

Autumn Falling (3 days) - Inauton - Harvest celebrations happen during Autumn Falling if the crops were particularly bountiful. If the harvest was small, supplication is given to the gods asking for a better harvest the following year.

Autumn Months

Early Autumn - Préauton
Mid Autumn - Majauton
Deep Autumn - Fonauton
Late Autumn - Tarauton

Winter Dusk (3 days) - Inivèrno (ihn-ih-VEHR-no) - Winter Dusk is filled with celebrations of life and vigils for the dead. The world is returning to sleep, plants die, and those still alive raise a toast to another year.

Winter Months

Early Winter - Préïvèrno (pree-ih-VEHR-no)
Mid Winter - Majivèrno (mahzh-ih-VEHR-no)"

      <DefaultText>Ruphec was a bruiser and a follower of Wael. He was often hired as a courier or bodyguard because of his size and strength. Yet he was a quiet man, and he developed a habit of walking with his head bowed in prayer. Because, of this, would-be thieves frequently attempted to waylay him.

But Ruphec was blessed by the god of secrets. With uncanny foresight, he dodged and parried these sudden attacks and slew his assailants, sewing their eyes into his cloak. He intended it as a warning, but others saw it as a challenge. 

Eventually, he discarded this cloak and wore a simpler, subtler garment in its place. The sight of a dark cloak with shimmering, shifting eyes became infamous among highwaymen and bandits.</DefaultText>

It was imbued with spells and magics to protect the wearer, and so it was extremely useful for travel through some of the contested regions on the border with Aedyr. 

The king gave the cape to his children while they traveled, and years later, they used it to protect their own children. The tradition continued for years after the formation of the Aedyr Empire until a Kulklin princess traveling with the cape eloped with the captain of her personal guard. The princess and her lover were never heard from again, but the cape surfaced decades later in Dyrwood.</DefaultText>

His exploits with women were even more famous than his skill with music, and though he claimed that his way with women came from his innate charm, he was never seen without a certain silver ring - even when he had divested himself of all else.

In the end, it was Cai's own indiscretions that led to his demise. He dallied with an assassin known as Faldila Rugia, and then he comforted the niece of the woman's most recent mark. What was an unfortunate coincidence for Cai looked like a suspicious alliance to the assassin, and she killed him in his sleep to prevent him from spilling her secrets.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This simple belt isn't much to look at, but it's been a favorite of savvy adventurers for years. Its snug but comfortable fit and its myriad pouches, sheaths, and loops allow the wearer quick access to weapons and tools. Armorers and leatherworkers have tried over the years to replicate the Coil of Resourcefulness - or even to improve it - but the ideal design remains a matter of controversy. All anyone can agree on is that none of the recently-produced belts are as good as the original.

Every few years, however, an adventurer will show up at an inn, campfire, or hunting lodge, claiming to wear the original Coil of Resourcefulness. Speculation will run rampant once again as supporters and detractors compare the most recent specimen to the various and contradictory accounts from old adventurers' journals.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This hat was designed by an apprentice wizard who sought to create the perfect magical accessory. He spent weeks binding spells and wards to the material, but when he finished, he felt that it looked rather plain. He wanted to strike an imposing figure for peers and rivals, so he spent a few more days adding embellishments - a crest of feathers behind one ear, a band of silk around the brim. It was an improvement, but it also showed the young wizard how poorly he'd chosen his  original color scheme, so he spent a few more days experimenting with other shades in suede, satin, and leather. 

While the poor young apprentice obsessed over his hat, his peers continued studying spells and hexes. By the time of his first duel, he had assembled a fantastic wardrobe but forgotten many of his spells. His performance ended his budding career in magic most ignominiously, but he went on to become a successful tailor.</DefaultText>

When she was young, she trained at a martial academy in Ozia, where she struggled at first. Many of her fellow students came from wealthy, local families, but she was poor and foreign. 

But she was clever, and she practiced much. One day, her chief rival - the nephew of one of the ducs bels - challenged her to a duel. Ryona could not refuse and save face, so she accepted. When they had assembled in the arena, he offered to give her one piece of his armor before the fight began. 

He meant it as an insult to her skill, but when Ryona asked for his belt, he realized his mistake. He gave her his belt, with his sheathed rapier still attached to it, effectively disarming himself. Ryona won the duel by default and kept the belt as a memento.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After Ryona established her reputation as a fighter, she began joining adventuring expeditions. For years, she was one of the most sought-after warriors in the Eastern Reach.

That changed after an expedition to the White March.

She traveled with a team of historians and treasure-hunters intent on breaching Durgan's Battery. Yet their guide fell ill, and they became hopelessly lost in a blizzard. The snows continued for days, and their provisions dwindled. While the rest of the party camped in the lee of a cliff, Ryona was sent to scout a way ahead. 

She wandered into the storm, barely able to see the hand in front of her face. After hours of trudging through the snow, Ryona stumbled into a cave.

Yet instead of shelter, she found a young alpine dragon.

The beast was too lean, and its eyes burned with hunger when it looked at Ryona. Yet she promised it a larger meal if only it would spare her. 

She led it to the hollow where the rest of her companions waited, and as the dragon turned on them, she fled. She lost the vambraces in the snow.</DefaultText>

"My efforts to instill even a child's intelligence in these creations have all failed. Most cannot hold a quill, much less set thoughts to paper. I believed for some time that subject sixty-three might have had a breakthrough during its lessons, but I discovered that it has simply been repeating my words, without comprehension.

These were not enlightened characters while they wore their original skins. Perhaps their essence lacks a fundamental capacity for learning? 

I have put them to the test in more martial arts, but here too they falter without the benefit of true sentience.  The Devil, of course, delights in mocking them. It is like boasting of besting children at combat.

      <DefaultText>A Giftbearer of Ondra is traveling along the road when she meets a man in tears holding a scrap of parchment. 

"Why do you weep?" asks the Giftbearer.

"I hold here a letter from my wife. I tried to be a good husband, but the letter says that I was not, and that she has gone to seek the company of a better man. Now this is all that remains of her."

"Give the letter to me, then," says the Giftbearer, "for once you have forgotten the letter, your wife can cause you no further pain."

 The man gives her the letter and finds his tears have dried up. He thanks the Giftbearer and leaves at peace.

The Giftbearer continues on, contemplating the man's story, but does not get far before she encounters an old woman in tears holding a string of beads.

"Why do you weep?" asks the Giftbearer.

"I hold here a string of beads that counted the years of my daughter's life. Sickness took her while she was still a child, and she was denied the joys of a full life, and I the joys of a mother. This is all that remains of her."

"Give the beads to me, then," says the Giftbearer, "for once you have forgotten the beads, your daughter can truly rest."

The old woman gives her the beads and finds her grief no longer gnaws at her soul. She thanks the Giftbearer and leaves at peace.

Thinking on the woman's pain, the Giftbearer follows the road until she reaches the sea. In her hands she carries the letter and the beads. They are light in her hands but heavy upon her heart, and she is crying. 

She prays to Ondra to allow the objects to be forgotten, and casts them into the water. And yet, long after they have sunk beneath the waves, the Giftbearer finds herself still weeping.

"Merciful Ondra," pleads the Giftbearer, "In your service I have helped people forget their troubles. Yet though I passed them on to you, I feel them still as though they were mine. How can this be?"

The Giftbearer listens to the wisdom of the crashing waves until she understands: to feel the troubles of others in your soul is a burden itself. However, she has no token to give to Ondra to bear it away, for the troubles are not hers to forget.

"I give myself to you, then," says the Giftbearer, "for once I am in your care, no memory may haunt me."

And with that, the tide comes forth and embraces the Giftbearer, and when it ebbs, she is gone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ritual of sprinkling holy water is one of the most important traditions in the Ondrite church. For Ondra's followers, it signifies not only a sanctifying of the church, but the actual presence of the Lady of Lament herself. All Ondrite holy water comes from the ocean, and those who convey the water from sea to church on pilgrimage are held in great esteem among the Ondrite faithful.

This aspergillum takes the traditional shape of a spherical vessel set at the end of a long handle, with holes bored into the top to allow water to flow outward when the item is flicked. More uniquely, the shaft has been carved to look as though barnacles cling to it, and the vessel at the end has been made to resemble the moon Beläfa. 

Salt appears to have crusted in long wisps that wind around the object.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This volume appears to serve many functions. There are notes in it detailing schedules and routines at the abbey. There are favorite passages from Ondrite texts, annotated with personal insights. There are also descriptions of dreams. Many seem purely symbolic, but one entry is of interest:

"It had been long since I dreamt of my Rising. Yet now, with another Rising soon upon us, this is the fifth time in a week. Perhaps channeled here, I can put it to rest.

"I am walking through the Halls of Silence. I feel eyes on me from all sides. Angry, vengeful eyes.

"I arrange the panels and curl my hands into the Sign of the Tide, the right as the wave, the left tracing the crescent moon with my two outer fingers. The way opens to me.

"I climb the steps and Ondra's Witness is installed there, the old aspergillum, set to operate the valves. I use it like a lever, and the water rises. There are angry shouts, and when I cover my ears, they are louder still.

"But the water continues upward, far past where it should. I climb as high as I can, but I feel it, icy on my feet. Then it is over my head, and I cannot breathe.

"Suddenly I am outside the reliquary, looking at the Veil of Tears. The Witness is in my hand, and the Veil parts for it. I step through, to the one place in the abbey I feel protected. Only when I pass inside, I come out in total darkness. 

"I call for help. I'm shouting, screaming for help. There is no answer. I stop.

"I sit there in the dark, waiting for what seems like ages. Then I realize: I don't know who I am."</DefaultText>

"We now have a treatment to prevent our prized cannons from rusting outside. Potionmaster Andren developed a solution that seals the metal, protecting it from cold air. We've transformed the old armory into a 'patination chamber' where we can heat the solution into a gas. As the gas suffuses the chamber, it will build up a hard coating on the cannons. After a few weeks, the cannons will be ready for the elements. 

However, we must be careful around the solution. One of Andren's assistants scalded her throat just from breathing too close to the stuff."

Few Engwithan weapons have been found in any kind of usable condition since Dyrwoodan expeditions began searching their ruins, but this morning star is a rare exception.

The weapon is composed of a bronze shaft and a head of living adra. The grip is wound tightly with copper, and the spikes on the head are also made from copper.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Captain Viccilo was a pirate captain, beloved by his crew for his sense of humor and notorious for his practical jokes. One day, the crew decided to get him back. They pretended to mutiny, and marooned him on a desert island for two days. They gave him only a hatchet for splitting coconuts, knowing the small island had no coconut trees.

When they dragged him back up onto the ship, he was half-dead of thirst, and the first mate offered him a cup of water. Viccilo gulped it all down, only to realize it was salt water, and he spent the next while vomiting on the deck, lacking even the energy to get up from the floor. The crew laughed at the spectacle, and Viccilo said afterward there were no hard feelings.

But Viccilo was a changed man after his brush with death. He laughed with his men, but beneath the surface he was full of rage. It took him weeks to fully recover, and when he felt well enough, he used his hatchet to murder his crew as they slept.

The hatchet is dark gray with red coral growing in veins along the handle and blade. Some of Captain Viccilo's vengeful essence is thought to have slipped into the blade, and some killed by it are believed to have died not from their wounds, but from dehydration.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A strictly devoted follower of Woedica, Wygelt was haunted by dreams of criminals committing horrific acts of violence, only to escape punishment or receive one that was unduly light. She came to believe Woedica was speaking to her through these dreams, demanding these people receive justice.

Wygelt found these criminals in hideouts and homes, and very often in jail, serving inadequate sentences. She would steal into these places, which were frequently under heavy guard, find her way to the criminal, and pronounce the judgment of Woedica. (Her incredible knack for reaching these places were in some instances later declared as miracles when she was canonized.) If the criminal was lucky, it would only mean disfigurement, but most were executed on the spot with Wygelt's cudgel.

Eventually Wygelt's reputation spread too far, and many criminals that feared her began to set traps and issue bounties. When she was finally caught, she was clubbed to death with her own weapon. It is said that with her final words, she declared that she was a murderer, and that she deserved this fate.

St. Wygelt's cudgel is a simple spiked club with a leather-wrapped handle. The wood itself is irreversibly stained reddish brown with the blood of criminals.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Silver Flash is the invention of Dyrwoodan silver prospector Engar Resc, who discovered a rich vein of silver in an otherwise empty cave. He had begun to mine it when the cave's owner - the largest bear he had ever seen, by his account - found him there and threatened to charge.

Engar had come prepared and discharged his blunderbuss at the beast as it ran at him, but the weapon rarely hit where it was aimed, and Engar was horribly mauled. Only by playing dead was he able to escape with his life.

Swearing to never allow it to happen again, Engar used some of his own silver to fashion a new blunderbuss that would never miss, and would slow the charge of any bear. The barrel is beautifully plated with a reflective silver, and engineered to create a blinding flash when it fires, bright enough to stop an animal in its tracks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A dozen unique pollaxes were created at the request of Escimo IV, Duc of Ancenze, to equip his royal bodyguards. Each was meant to pay tribute to one of the governing factors of maritime fortune. Additional pollaxes were made to honor the rain, the stars, the sun, the waves, and other symbols.

The Wind's Arm was the personal favorite of Escimo IV, who had earned his nickname "Casità mel Alisias" - the Captain of the Wind - in his years serving the Ancenzan navy. It was said of Escimo that whichever way he needed to go, the winds would already be blowing that way. He gave the Wind's Arm to his most skilled guard, who called upon it more than once to keep overexcited Vailians from getting too close to the throne.

The pollaxe is made in the image of the wind itself. A face is engraved on the axe head, blowing wind outward along the curves of the blade. The grain of the wood itself is not vertical, but rather sweeps around the ash-gray pole.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ine Gyrd, the most famous scepter in Aedyr and perhaps all of Eora, is held jointly by the mecwyn and fercönyng as a symbol of royal authority, and is said to carry the souls of early chieftains in its adra head. Though traditionally thought of as symbolic, there have been a few notable times in history when it was put to practical use. 

In one such instance, Mecwyn Eleya I had her claim to the throne challenged by an older half-sister claiming to be a legitimate heir. Eleya invited her to court so that people might hear her words with their own ears and judge for themselves. The woman spoke at length and showed a number of sworn documents to those present at court. Eleya summoned her to the throne, and told her that if the chieftains of Ine Gyrd judged her worthy, the mecwyn would abdicate.</DefaultText>

He was careful to request that it differ completely in appearance from Ine Gyrd, lest he draw the attention and ire of the mecwyn. 

Though Gyrd Háewanes Sténes does not contain the souls of the gréf's bloodline, it does tend to project the authority of the wielder, as the original owner intended.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The only surviving son of an indentured servant, Adaryc Cendamyr was one of countless Readcerans who joined the ranks of Waidwen's army upon the outbreak of the Saint's War. Despite his youth and inexperience, Adaryc acquitted himself well in the fighting, and was soon popular among his fellow soldiers for his good sense, his passion, and his loyalty. Determined to honor Waidwen, Adaryc proved himself a disciplined and driven soldier.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After a spate of hard-won victories, the destruction of Waidwen heralded the immediate retreat of Readceran forces back across the border. Situated far from the vanguard, Adaryc's company found itself embroiled in brutal fighting as triumphant Dyrwood forces set upon their disheartened foe. 

His commander slain, Adaryc had his first taste of command in the chaos. Adaryc and his fellows held off the enemy long enough for their company to rejoin the main body of the retreating army - but at the cost of many lives. 

It would be nearly a year later before Adaryc would be able to revisit the battlefield, but he returned to Readceras with the broken blades of several of his fallen brothers in arms. It was from these shattered remnants that Adaryc's sword was forged.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Adaryc maintained contact with the surviving members of his unit after the war. Though he had struggled with bouts of melancholy since childhood, Adaryc was well-regarded as a capable and charismatic leader, devoted to his comrades. It was soon proposed that he should lead the others in forming a tight-knit collective of fighting men, united not by a desire for coin, but by their duty to their fallen comrades, and to their countrymen. 

Many of the Iron Flail's early engagements would be against less discerning mercenary companies, which Adaryc condemned as a particular danger to settlements along the Readceran border. In time, the Iron Flail's many victories, and Adaryc's seemingly dauntless will, would draw many more recruits into the fold. The Iron Flail soon had the backing of several prominent families, and was even rumored to have the blessing of Readceras' ruling powers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Local chapters of the Guild of the Poison Scale, a group of fanatical Woedican assassins who believe the world is safest when no single entity wields too much power, spread from Aedyr to Dyrwood in the years before the Dyrwoodan revolution, and have continued to operate there since.

Darden Guthroc failed his first assignment as a member of the New Heomar branch of the Poison Scale. It was not for lack of skill, but rather lack of contingency planning, that his attack was spoiled. He tracked an ascendant young noble to his lover's abode, and waited all night from a rooftop across the road, his crossbow trained on the door.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Simple" might be as specific as one can be when describing this dagger. Its handle is leather-wrapped and plain. Its blade is bronze. It has no markings, no filigree, no gems or fancy metalwork. It appears well made, but it is so unremarkable that it is a challenge to judge. 

There is a sense in holding it that there must be something more there, if only because it is difficult to believe any craftsman would take so little pride in his work.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It is difficult to say for sure, but the blade seems to have picked up tarnish with use, despite the relatively light usage it has seen since you acquired it. It is hard to imagine that the blade was made so cheaply that it is already near the end of its lifespan, yet it does not appear to be far off.

A single rune is visible along the blade. At first it looked more like a scratch. It seems impossible to remember now whether that rune had always been there.</DefaultText>

There are deep scratches across it now, and it seems that all but the softest materials leave their mark upon it. Blobs of rust are spattered across the blade, and seem to spread from one moment to the next. They eat at the metal like a wasting sickness. The leather on the handle has begun to slough off entirely, and it needs to be secured in the palm to ensure a good grip before every use.

Four runes are visible along the blade. It seems increasingly likely that it is some kind of apology in a dead language.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The best swindlers know how to put on a good show. Many charm with their words or with sleight-of-hand, but Elryn made his living with his eye for fashion. The son of a tailor, Elryn picked up his father's trade when his father died, but soon found that his love of stitching far outstripped his desire to keep ledgers, and it wasn't long before he was on the street with no means of plying his trade.

But while begging for coins, he noticed that he fared better than the other beggars, and eventually he realized it was because the jacket he wore - one that he had fashioned himself - drew attention. When he had scraped together enough money, he poured it into making a jacket so splendid and unique that it would disarm even the wariest of passersby. 

It worked exactly as he intended. And in fact so disarming was the jacket that he found he could read and beguile people quite easily once he'd drawn them in with it. He made promises he couldn't keep. He picked pockets with his left hand while pointing out the jacket's fine detail work with his right. In a matter of months, he had money enough to buy back and reopen his father's shop. But thrill and convenience of his new profession kept Elryn right where he was, begging and sweet talking and manipulating. At the end of each day he would steal away to a fine abode on the other side of town where no one knew him.

Things took a turn for Elryn when he met a young woman who captivated him from the moment he laid eyes on her. He tried to work his charms on her but found instead that he tripped over his own tongue and could barely get a word out. Yet the woman seemed to enjoy his efforts in spite of it all, and he finally convinced her to come to his home. He awoke the next morning to find his house had been emptied of every valuable and coin he'd ever saved or swindled, and only then did he realize it hadn't been the woman that captivated him at all - it had been her stunning velvet bodice - and he knew he'd been had by a kindred soul. Alas, his prized jacket was among the items she removed, and Elryn lived out the rest of his days in poverty.

Where most padded armor is constructed in vertical strips, Elryn's jacket bears a distinctive diamond pattern. It has a high collar and long sleeves that go all the way to the wrists, and it has an uncanny way of catching people off-guard.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Matha Faett was discovered slumbering in an Engwithan ruin deep in the heart of Eir Glanfath. She was a great worm, a subterranean animal rarely seen by kith. Nearly all of her body was burrowed in the dirt beyond the walls of the ruin, so the Dyrwoodan looters that provoked her were more than a little shocked to see that when she emerged she was perhaps three times the height of a person, and thirty times as long.

The initial group of looters escaped with their lives, and returned with large hunting parties aimed at slaying her, for the ruins she took over were home to one of the finest collections of relics yet found in Eir Glanfath. But Matha Faett killed those hunters by the score. Her body was coated in an acidic mucus that devoured weapons before they could pierce her flesh, and she vomited bile upon her attackers that burned away flesh and bone alike, leaving no trace of them for future looters to find.

Her reign there ended when the Hounds of Galawain were paid a vast sum to see her destroyed. They sent one woman, Cillanna Fealmes, whose stature was such that few questioned her going in alone. She ordered built a set of custom weapons and armor, including this breastplate, which was blackened to resist the monster's corrosive bile. 

She entered the ruins to find Matha Faett  had died sometime in the last month, and the smell was so overpowering that it knocked her unconscious for hours.

When she emerged from the ruins unscathed in her black armor, she was nicknamed the Blackwarden before she could even recount the tale. So much did she like the nickname that the happily bent the truth in order to keep it. 

The smell did not leave the armor until well after Cillanna's death, and it has seen very little wear as a result.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It began as nothing more than an accident. A Dyrwoodan hunter on an expedition stepped on the tail of a sleeping stelgaer and the animal would have torn into him except one of its teeth became lodged in the hunter's mail, affording him an opportunity to slay the beast. The tooth he left in the mail as a kind of trophy.

Other expeditions would gain him new trophies - teeth or bones - which he would sew into the armor's links as a point of pride. The hunter himself was eventually slain by a group of Fangs who found him walking out of an Engwithan ruin with a bag full of things they did not feel were his. But they kept up his tradition, sewing one of the hunter's teeth into the mail. 

Over the years, they added to the collection, until the wearer was killed. The mail would change hands from time to time in this way when the owner was slain by a beast or someone with a grudge, but without fail, each new owner would add his trophies to the mail, and the armor is now a fearsome pastiche of the remains of beasts and people alike.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Right Lord Lorel Taenring found himself in the unenviable position of being caught in a war between two branches of his own family, fought over hunting rights to certain lands that were jointly owned. While most family members found it easy to choose a side, Lorel could not bring himself to take up arms against anyone in his large extended family. 

He had this brigandine decorated in two tones, each representing the opposing family banners, and had the local spellwrights imbue it with the power to raise a wall of briars, which he hoped to use to keep the sides divided on the battlefield.

When the two sides met in combat, he rode out to the center of the battlefield, raising briar patches and waving to both sides, calling out for them to stop their mad feud. Unfortunately, his decorative brigandine had the opposite effect of what he intended, and each side read it as being the uniform of the other. He was felled by a rain of arrows from both directions.

When his family realized he had died, they put their battle on hold and discussed peace. Then they began to argue about where Lorel would be buried and the feud began anew.</DefaultText>

She played and cheated her way across the Dyrwood, and she was playing a game with the off-duty soldiers at Hel's Gate Citadel when an extra die clattered out of her sleeve. She fled, and the drunken soldiers at the table grabbed their weapons and gave chase. 

The alarm went up across the citadel, and the gambler dodged the spears and arrows of the emerging guards as she made her way to the edge of the island. When she reached the cliffs, she skidded to a halt, cast a single glance at the pursuing soldiers, and tumbled into the sea. Half of the guards on duty that night tried to claim credit for the arrow or spear that must have knocked her into the water, but when they retrieved her cape from the branch that had snagged it, they found that it was whole. Her body was never found.</DefaultText>

When she learned that her love meant to challenge the marceso for her affections, she enchanted his gauntlet to protect him during the duel. When the young captain threw it at the marceso's feet, the two men drew swords and fought across the grounds of the marceso's palace.

Whenever they sparred near the fallen gauntlet, the captain had the upper hand. Yet every time the young captain drove the marceso back, the tide turned.

Eventually, the captain caught wise. He allowed the marceso to press him once more. As they passed the fallen gauntlet, he threw his strength into one final onslaught, winning the duel - and the hand of his beloved - with his blade at the marceso's throat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A young knight sought a legendary armorer beneath the mountains of the Living Lands. The knight brought a fortune in gold and asked the armorer to craft something exquisite to protect her on her adventures. The old armorer agreed on the condition that the young knight would apprentice with him for three years to learn the basics of his trade.

The young knight agreed and worked at the armorer's side day and night, fashioning breastplates, greaves, cuisses, and shields. As the third year drew to a close, she waited to see what marvelous piece the armorer would craft for her, yet the old man never picked up a hammer but to correct her technique.

On the final evening of her apprenticeship, she approached the armorer and asked about the reward he had promised. He counseled patience and told her that he would finish it by morning.

When she arose the next day, she found him sitting by the hearth, twisting a length of rope. "I've done all you asked," she said. "I've served you faithfully and learned your trade. Where is the armor you promised me?"

"It is here," the old man said, holding up the rope.

"You vowed to grant me a great protection," the knight said, her hand moving to her blade.

"And so I have. You have worked at my side for three years. You have seen how even the strongest steel shatters, dents, and rusts. The greatest protection is not bent metal, but mastery over your own mind. With this, even the gravest wounds shall not stop you."</DefaultText>

By the time Ryona arrived, House Doemenel had already put out a contract on his life.

However, though he had made many fine clothes for himself, he had no shoes to match, no invitation from the imperial family, and no knowledge of palace manners. 

One day, a kindly wizard heard his wish and gifted him with an enchanted pair of shoes. They were formal enough for the ball, and the wizard promised that they would provide all Viettro needed in time. 

Viettro took the wizard at his word and arrived at the palace gates the day of the ball, dressed in his best clothes and his new shoes. The guards on duty demanded Viettro's invitation, and suddenly, the young man felt a weight in his pocket. He found a flask of fine spirits, which he gave the guards in exchange for entry. 

Continuing to the ball, he found himself in conversation with several vicecomtes and marcesos. Viettro was certain his ignorance would betray him, but he spoke with such knowledge of history and custom that his hosts were impressed. 

His confidence in the wizard's shoes grew, and when he saw the most beautiful woman at the ball, he asked her to dance. The shoes guided his feet and his tongue, and such was his charm that he and the young príncessa were wed by the year's end. </DefaultText>

Her parents were thrilled about the match, yet as the day of her wedding drew nearer, Gwyn suffered from horrible nightmares that she was suffocating. She would awaken, gasping for breath but otherwise unable to move. 

She told her parents about the nightmares and the horrible weight that seemed to press on her shoulders more and more each passing day. They assured her that the nerves would pass, but they didn't. 

On the morning of her wedding day, when the sky was still gray and a heavy mist hung over the fields, Gwyn snuck away. She thought a long walk might calm her, but the further she got from Forked Vale, the better she felt. By the time she reached Pearlwood Bluffs, she realized she had no intention of going back.

She spent the night at a little roadside inn on the charity of the owner, and after a hot dinner and a good mug of ale, she enjoyed the best sleep she'd had in months. When she awoke, her hostess pointed her to Defiance Bay.

I appreciate that you are attempting to assist me, but when I asked for volunteers, I meant just that. I have no interest in raising corpses, and these sorry victims of yours are of no use to me. I have taken precautions to prevent us finding ourselves hip-deep in guls. While you clean up the midden heap you have made of my ritual circle, perhaps you can take the time to refamiliarize yourself with the simple concept that a dead man makes a poor source of soul essence.

      <DefaultText>"My love,

I have enclosed some coins from Stalwart, so you have proof that I arrived. 

You were right. I am colder than I have ever been. All the more so for being away from you.

The kith here are as cold as their land. They do not hate us as the Dyrwoodans do, but they are mistrustful and proud.
The commander has sent for delegates to start negotiations. Perhaps, by the time this letter reaches you, we will have moved into Durgan's Battery.

Stalwart has no soldiers, only a handful of guards. Efram says he went to look at the Battery with some scouts, and did not see anyone posted atop the tower. Without those cannons, they would be foolish to do anything but surrender.
If not, we're sure to knock the fight out of them quickly.

The Commander says that once the Battery is ours, our presence here alone may be enough to make the invaders think twice. 
Who would face us with the might of the Battery at our backs?

I write too much of battle, but only to assure you that we are well. 

I miss you.

The mountains are beautiful. I hold hope that you may see them for yourself, once it is safe for you to join us."</DefaultText>

"The lever for the artillery lift has broken again. I've been telling my men to be as careful as possible while using the lift, but it's difficult to keep your balance on the thing. One bad bump nearly sent a handful of them off the edge and I'd rather they break a lever to keep their balance than fall off. Unfortunately, it was a clean break this time. We'll need this lever as soon as possible."

Scrawled across the bottom in thick ink is an additional note:

"If your men stopped taking up so much ammunition at a time this wouldn't be a problem. This'll be the last lever you ever get. Next time you're just getting a rammer."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Mind grubs are today considered a vithrack delicacy, but the mind grub harvests are said to have very pragmatic origins. Mind grubs undergo a prolonged development cycle, starting out as pale, fragile larvae and ultimately undergoing a dramatic metamorphosis into large and highly dangerous adults. Few kith have encountered these creatures in the wild and lived to tell the tale, and the notoriously insular vithrack are not forthcoming with information, but a few more lurid fables suggest that the mind grubs are all that remains of a second, sentient culture that once vied with the vithrack for dominance. In any case, the vithrack are content to devour them in the early stages.

Consuming mind grubs is said to heighten the senses and sharpen the wits, but the grubs themselves are all but indigestible to kith, who tend to come out of the experience with an upset stomach.</DefaultText>

She lost one of her eyes and all of her teeth, but she defeated the beast and received the shield on what many expected would be her deathbed. However, Rinetta recovered and lived a long life, to the consternation of many. 

She ceased hunting dragons and took to training pupils, of which she had many - all were eager to learn from the steward of the Dragon's Maw Shield, and many hoped she might pass it on to them. Yet her contemporaries grumbled that she should pass it on if she had given up the hunt, and they complained that no hunter should profit financially from the shield. Rinetta eventually bestowed it on another hunter, but by that time, she was a very wealthy woman.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The twins Marad and Devna hunted dragons together for many years. They became successful, yet it was handsome Marad that their peers and admirers loved best. Devna was sharp-tongued and plain, and though her skill with a spear was undeniable, she always lived in her brother's shadow. 

They had fought and hunted together for almost twenty years when the Dragon's Maw Shield passed to Marad. Devna congratulated her brother and accepted his honor as gracefully as she could - after all, the shield had always had a single steward - but some saw resentment in her simmering in her eyes. Others said her reflexes slowed and her aim faltered. Whispers circulated that she was past her prime.

Within a year of Marad's receiving the shield, he perished beneath the claws of a sand dragon. Devna survived and retrieved the shield, but many blamed her failing skills for her dashing brother's death. Others suspected that she killed him in a fit of jealously. Whatever the case, she quickly passed the shield to a successor and lived the remainder of her days as a recluse.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lirat the swineherd never wanted to be a dragon hunter, but when his village drew the attention of a particularly nasty crag dragon, he was chosen to deal with it. Armed with his uncle's rusty sword and a single dose of heathbush poison - just in case - he set out to find the beast. 

The dragon was not hard to find - Lirat could hear its snores from half a mile away and smell it from farther still. He followed a trail of bones to a cave where the beast lay sleeping, surrounded by the bodies of dead and dying pigs. As Lirat entered the cave, one of the wounded swine squealed. This woke the dragon, which swallowed the pig whole. Only then did the beast notice Lirat, and in its surprise, it choked on the pig. 

Lirat nearly died of fright as he watched the dragon writhe and convulse. But the dying pig had lodged itself firmly in the dragon's unfortunately long throat, and within minutes, the monster was dead.

Despite his protests, Lirat was hailed as a hero. As world of his deed spread (and as the supposed size of his dragon grew), he attracted the attention of Turran the Bold, who passed the shield to the young swineherd. Lirat enjoyed a year of feasts and fetes, but when questions circulated about his next conquest, he passed the shield to another hunter.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What a strange and marvelous place we have found! 

Our fathers and mothers decided early that proper defenses should be among our first priorities here, and so we built tall, sturdy walls and cast cannons at the forge. Yet as high as our walls are, the mountains are higher still, and so at Gabel's rather brilliant suggestion, we built a high tower and arrayed it with our finest cannons. With such defenses, no army in the world could besiege us!

Yet we encountered a problem. Biting winds and snow-laden gales sweep the top of the tower day and night, every season of every year, freezing not only our sentries, but also our cannons. We constructed a boiler capable of warming both, fed as it was by the heat of the forge. But placing it proved more difficult than we had imagined. Our first attempt trapped too much of the smoke in the forge itself, and our second warped in the heat, so badly that it nearly dropped the boiler into the forge itself! What a disaster that would have been.

We needed a material capable of withstanding the forge's heat while conducting it to the boiler. And we needed a design sturdy enough to support the weight of the boiler without insulating it from the heat.

It was then that one of our hunting parties returned with a strange artifact.

It looked like a skeletal hand, but it was enormous. The hunters claimed to have found it stuck in a crag, though they had no idea as to what it came from - or how it ended up there! - as there were no other remains nearby. It had taken all of their number to wrest it from its place, and even that was only possible because the thing had not been frozen to the crag. 

Now, each of us has seen our own breath freeze in our beards. I laughed and asked how their account was possible, and with the look of men and women who doubt their own tales, they told me ice and snow melted from the hand almost instantly. I confess, I doubted them, too, until I placed my hands on the great bones and felt a strange heat radiating from them. This was either a strange blessing or a stranger curse.

We called for Durgan himself.

Old and frail as he was, Durgan spent a day and a night alone in the hall where we'd left the hand, praying and meditating. He emerged with an energy that none had seen in him since the day he found the forge. He declared the hand a gift from Abydon himself, and one not to be squandered. At his suggestion, we installed the hand beneath the boiler, where it proved a strong support and a superb conductor of heat. What lends it these properties we do not know, but we have learned better than to question a fortunate gift in this cold and unforgiving land."</DefaultText>

      <ID>2530</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We have all heard the legends of Ondra and Senn Beläfa, and the explanation that the goddess' love for the moon causes the tides. And, as men and women of science, we know this to be but a shadow of truth. 

Yet there is another myth that we have been quicker to dismiss, and I wonder if it does not merit further examination.

Ondrites tell of a smaller moon, Ionni Brathr, that the goddess supposedly pulled from the sky in an earlier age. And while such a thing seems impossible, for Ionni Brathr still roams the skies above, it is true that explorers in the far reaches have found mineral fragments that do not naturally occur on any known continent in Eora. 

Furthermore, naturalists in Aedyr, Rauatai, and the Dyrwood have observed the remains of ancient ocean life many miles inland. Such a thing would only be possible if Eora's oceans had once been larger, or - as I here propose! - if a catastrophic flood had once washed over the continents. While few phenomena could cause a flood of this magnitude, a large body falling into the seas just might do the trick. 

In these pages, I will explain how some force of nature - if not an amorous goddess - could have pulled a small moon into Eora millennia ago..."</DefaultText>

      <ID>2532</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of all the stories of all the gods, no doubt one of the most charming is the legend of Abydon's Hands.

In some cultures, Abydon's Hands are tiny, cheerful creatures that hide in the walls and in the cracks between paving stones. In others, they are silent men of stone who roam distant lands. In all such tales, however, they are Abydon's constructs, built in his image to continue his good work of creating strong and wondrous things in this world. 

Thus, upon spying a mighty mountain peak, or a row of adra pillars, or another natural marvel, parents and nursemaids will tell young children that these are the work of Abydon's Hands. 

Such is the appeal of Abydon as a deity, as it is through his legend that we recognize familiar shapes in the natural world. Thus, when we see a landform that resembles a colonnade, or an arched gate, or a mighty home, we see a hand and a purpose at work that is not unlike our own. 

And while Abydon's own identity as a construct is alienating to some, to many of us, his crude yet practical shape is comforting. While the other gods take the form of birds, beast, and sea, Abydon takes the shape of our most common tools and constructions. His debasement in a body of iron elevates our own works and labors, and it offers us a grand hope. For if a god could rebuild himself out of iron, what wonders might kith create with their own hands?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Part paramilitary navy and part mercantile trade guild, the Royal Deadfire Company strives to spread Rauataian hegemony throughout the Deadfire Archipelago. The RDC boasts iron-shod ships bristling with heavy weaponry, crewed by loyal and efficient sailors - advantages that help the company maintain an influential presence in the region.

This belt of fine sharkskin bears the geometric tooling common to Rauatain fashion, and within the shallow grooves of each right angle hide arcane sigils. Though its material does not feel unusual to the touch, the belt imparts the wearer a feeling of comfortable warmth.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Huana, a cultural alliance of aumaua tribes native to the Deadfire Archipelago, stand in opposition to the predations of the Príncipi pirates and the machinations of the mercantile companies that would exploit the Deadfire. The Mataru, the Huana's military caste, both exercise power over the tribes and defend them against their many enemies and the dangers of the sea.

A Deadfire woodworker carved this sturdy club, blessed by the priests of Ngati, to be top heavy and etched it with symbols of the sea. Its once-bright paints have been all but erased by time and hard use.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The dreaded Príncipi sen Patrena prowl the seas of the Deadfire, a persistent threat to the organized trading companies and to outlaw smugglers and slavers alike. These pirates originated as refugees from Old Vailia, and some of them continue to maintain the traditions of that land. Others are as brutal and anarchistic a group of freebooters to have ever roamed the waves.

Due to the dangers presented by firearms aboard ships, many raiders prefer crossbows. This almost ridiculously heavy arbalest fires bolts with enough force to knock its victims from their feet. Gold-leaf accents on the stock and stirrup differentiate it as a work of Vailian engineering from more common crossbows. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sweep of this sword's steel suggests the tumultuous waves of an angry sea. Its blade always feels a tad cooler to the touch than you expect, and water beads along its length, a fine wet layer that seems to add to the weapon's heft. 

Though hardly unheard of in the Dyrwood, sabres tend to be wielded more frequently aboard ships, where sailors eschew heavy armor that can spell death for a mariner pitched overboard. The symbol of Ondra stamped into this sabre's blade suggests a similar origin for it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though never as famed as he would claim, the Vailian explorer Fulvano was known as an eccentric who wished to see the world. Where possible, he traveled by foot, wishing to gain a local's appreciation for the sights, sounds, and smells of the lands as he passed through. In practice, however, Fulvano often claimed that his explorations proved only that the world outside of the Vailian Republics was a foul, smelly place that paled in comparison to his homeland.

Though known more for his wanderlust than any great martial skill, Fulvano possessed an appraising eye for gear, and this blunderbuss seems no exception. Despite its worn surface, this firearm functions as if it were made yesterday, its firing mechanism smooth and its aim as true as one can expect for a shot-slinger. 

The pristine condition may suggest that Fulvano never actually fired his gun, lending credence to an otherwise apocryphal quote often attributed to him: "Lead and steel can rid you of an enemy, but only wine transforms an enemy into a friend."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The weather on the high seas swings between extremes of blisteringly dry heat and the brutally wet coldness of nighttime storms. Sailors who can afford to do so prefer to wear layers, matching warm coats with shirts or blouses of light, breathable materials. 

Pirates, in particular, given the import of reputation and infamy in their culture, tend towards gaudy, flamboyant clothing that not only displays their ill-gotten goods, but serves as identification that can help intimidate victims or ward away foes.

The helmsman guides the ship from the wheel. The role requires significant strength to wrestle the rudder against the force of the ocean, and the focus and resilience to remain attentive through violent storms, bloody combat, and almost interminable stretches of boredom.</DefaultText>

When they pulled her towards the stairs to the main deck and a watery grave, Yuraska used the only hope left to her. Setting her eyes upon the powder stores, she spoke an incantation and threw a spark.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Mercario Menzallini, a pioneering member of the Vailian Trade Company's interests in the Deadfire, cared far less for trade than the mother who pressured him to follow in her mercantile footsteps. As a mate aboard a VTC galley, he set to sea with a bitter mixture of dread and resentment, sure that he would never return home again.

      <DefaultText>By the time Menzallini's ship reached the Deadfire, he found himself captain via promotion through attrition. The captain the ship set sail with took a bullet during a skirmish with an Aedyran galleon off of the southern tip of the continent, while her replacement had the incredible misfortune to fall overboard during an attack by a barbed ravager.

Yet Menzallini proved a remarkably competent captain. Humbled by his own inexperience, he listened to the counsel of his sailors, and he rewarded them in turn with finer rations and heavier sacks of coin than they could expect on other ships.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though beloved by his crew, Menzallini's voyages proved less profitable than those of more parsimonious captains, and the VTC recalled him to the Republics with the intent of stripping him of his command. He was warned in advance, however, by one of his former navigators whose relatively high wages under Menzallini had allowed her to eventually take a bookkeeper's position in the homeland. 

Rather than return his vessel and its crew to the Republics, Menzallini pulled down the VTC colors and offered them to any hands who would rather remain with the company than join him in his sedition. When no one accepted the offer, he folded the colors and locked them away. He then threw his hat into the sea, turned the bow towards the horizon, and set forth for waters uncharted.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The priests claimed the weapon a potent artifact. Originally crafted for the warrior-priest Timauko, who later became a chieftain of the tribe, it passed to his soul's heir after he gave his life to stop a kraken from preying on the tribe's spear fishers. 

As a club carved from the roots of a tree that grew twined among an outcropping of adra, the priests taught that it drew forth the memories of the soul that bore it prior from the warrior who wielded it. With each Mataru who took it up, the weapon would gain power, and the longer a warrior wielded it, the more of that power they could rely on. </DefaultText>

Though the Huana rebuffed the Vailian aggression, Durama's boat was struck by a cannonball that reduced it to a bloody jumble of splintered planks and disembodied limbs. Her club was never seen by the Huana again.</DefaultText>

As the foremost among the mates, the boatswain manages most of the rest of the crew. This requires not only a firm grasp on every aspect of seamanship, but also a constant awareness of the state of the ship and crew. A superlative boatswain marries these traits to a strong capacity for leadership. A well-liked boatswain can be the difference between an unhappy crew and a mutinous mob.</DefaultText>
