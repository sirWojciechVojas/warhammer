Major's 3D Dice

NOTICE: ONLINE FEATURES WILL BE DOWN TEMPORARILY FROM OCTOBER 30, TO MID NOVEMBER!
I am moving and the only server for the online portion of the dice roller is on a machine I must ship to another state.
You can still use the offline portion available on the github page in the meantime. ( https://majorvictory.github.io/3DDiceRoller/ )

Uses three.js and cannon.js to simulate actual dice and read their results.

Original code based from Tealyatina's dice roller
http://www.teall.info/2014/01/online-3d-dice-roller.html

Heavily modified, rewritten, and extended to add textures, dice, and color sets.
